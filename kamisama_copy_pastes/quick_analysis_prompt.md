# Quick GDScript Analysis Prompt

I'm working on Universal Being (Godot 4.5) - a game where everything is conscious and can evolve. 

**Pentagon Architecture**: All beings must implement:
- pentagon_init() → pentagon_ready() → pentagon_process() → pentagon_input() → pentagon_sewers()

**File**: [filename.gd]
```gdscript
[PASTE CODE HERE]
```

Please:
1. Check Pentagon Architecture compliance
2. Find bugs/issues
3. Suggest improvements
4. Make it work better with the Universal Being system
5. Create TODO list
