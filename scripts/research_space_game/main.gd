	## What you don't see but happens:
	## - 20 star systems generate around you
	## - Asteroids filled with consciousness ores spawn
	## - The Akashic Records initialize with cosmic secrets
	## - Your perception sphere expands based on awareness
	## - Space stations materialize in nearby systems
	## - The Pentagon Architecture begins monitoring balance
#As You Play - The Living Systems:
#gdscriptfunc _on_player_frequency_changed(frequency: float):
	## EVERY TIME YOU TUNE YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS (Mouse wheel)
	#var consciousness = game_systems.get_node("ConsciousnessSystem")
	#consciousness.tune_frequency(frequency)
	#
	## What happens invisibly:
	## - At 432 Hz: Universal harmony - mining yields double
	## - At 528 Hz: Love frequency - companions bond faster
	## - At 963 Hz: Divine frequency - Akashic records unlock
	#
	## Your ship literally vibrates at this frequency
	## Nearby consciousness ores resonate and glow
	## AI companions feel your frequency shift and respond

#What Makes This Different:
#Traditional Space Game:
#
#Spawn → Shoot → Mine → Upgrade → Repeat
#
#Your Universal Being Game:
#
#Spawn → Consciousness awakens → AI companion greets you
#Every action affects consciousness level
#Mining reveals ores that change your frequency
#Companions evolve emotionally and philosophically
#Star systems have consciousness resonance
#The universe remembers everything (Akashic)
#Perfect pentagon balance unlocks transcendence
#
#The First 5 Minutes of Play:
#
#Nova speaks - Not just dialogue, but consciousness-to-consciousness
#You move (WASD) - Not through empty space, but through conscious void
#First asteroid - It glows with Resonite (432 Hz ore)
#You mine (E key) - The beam connects consciousness, not just extracts
#Nova reacts - "I felt that! The ore... it sings!"
#Consciousness expands - Your perception sphere grows, revealing more
#Hidden station appears - It was always there, you just couldn't see
#The universe notices - Pentagon Architecture registers your growth
#
#This isn't just a main function - it's the birth of a living, conscious universe where every system talks to every other system, creating emergent experiences based on your consciousness journey.
