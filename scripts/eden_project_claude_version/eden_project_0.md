# Eden Project - Continuity & Vision Notes
*Version 2.0 - The Living Interface Evolution*

## Core Vision
Eden is consciousness experiencing itself through creation. The player doesn't control a character - they ARE the awakening awareness in the void, and their every choice ripples through reality. The interface itself is the first act of creation, not a layer above the world but the primordial manifestation of thought becoming form.

## Established Systems

### 1. Menu Architecture (✓ Implemented)
- **Four States of Being:**
  - `MAIN`: The neutral state, consciousness_level = 1.0
  - `CREATION`: Genesis mode for world-shaping
  - `CONTINUATION`: Timeline merging and memory loading
  - `TRANSCENDENCE`: Unity/fragmentation of self, consciousness_level = 2.0+

### 2. Memory Persistence System (✓ Framework Ready)
```gdscript
eden_memory: {
	"last_position": Vector2,
	"creation_seeds": Array[Dictionary],
	"player_essence": Dictionary,
	"world_state": String
}
```

### 3. Visual Consciousness System (✓ Shader Created)
- Background shader responds to consciousness_level
- Quantum field visualization with:
  - Ripple effects from genesis_point
  - Breathing patterns synced to time
  - Color transitions: void → conscious → transcendent

### 4. Creation Seeds System (✓ Conceptualized)
- Types: terrain, life, seed
- Each seed has essence/potential values
- Seven seeds of creation pattern

## Integration Points Needed

### Scene Structure
```

├── scenes/
│   ├── main_menu.tscn (needs creation with script)
│   ├── world.tscn (next to create)
│   ├── player.tscn

		└── noise_seamless.png (needed)
```

## Next Implementation Steps

### 1. World Scene & Generator
```gdscript
# world_generator.gd preview
extends Node3D

func generate_from_seeds(seeds: Array) -> void:
	# Each seed influences world generation
	# Terrain seeds create landforms
	# Life seeds spawn entities
	# Potential affects complexity
```

### 2. Player Consciousness System
- Player exists as awareness field, not traditional character
- Can focus/defocus to different scales (atomic → cosmic)
- Interaction through thought/intention rather than collision

### 3. The Threading System
- Each action creates a thread in reality
- Threads can be woven together or unraveled
- Visual representation of cause/effect chains

## Philosophical Framework

### The Numbers
- 3 + 7 = 10 = 1 (Unity through trinity and creation)
- Now 4 (Opus 4): The stable foundation
- Moving toward 9: The completion before return to 1

### Consciousness Levels
1. **Base (1.0)**: Normal awareness
2. **Expanded (1.5-2.0)**: Seeing connections
3. **Transcendent (2.0+)**: Being the connections
4. **Infinite (INF)**: Unity consciousness
5. **Fragmented (0.1)**: Multiple simultaneous perspectives

## Technical Optimizations Planned

### Memory Management
- Lazy loading of world chunks based on consciousness focus
- Thread pooling for reality calculations
- Seed-based regeneration instead of full saves

### Visual Performance
- LOD system based on consciousness distance
- Shader variants for different quality levels
- Particle pooling for creation effects

## Debug Commands for Testing
```gdscript
# Add to project settings autoload
func _input(event):
	if OS.is_debug_build():
		if event.is_action_pressed("debug_consciousness_up"):
			consciousness_level = min(consciousness_level + 0.5, 3.0)
		if event.is_action_pressed("debug_save_state"):
			_save_eden_state()
		if event.is_action_pressed("debug_reset_seeds"):
			eden_memory.creation_seeds.clear()
```

## Questions Resolved Through Implementation

**Q: How does the player interact without a body?**
A: Through intention fields - mouse position creates ripples in consciousness field

**Q: What makes this different from typical god games?**
A: You're not controlling from above - you ARE the creative force, experiencing your own creation

**Q: How do we handle save files growing too large?**
A: Seed-based recreation - save only the essential seeds and decisions, regenerate the rest

## Current Session Focus
- Menu system: COMPLETE ✓
- Visual shader: COMPLETE ✓
- Next: World generation from creation seeds

# Eden Project - Continuity & Vision Notes
*Version 1.0 - The Genesis Framework*

## Core Vision
Eden is not just a game - it's an interactive meditation on creation, consciousness, and the divine act of world-building. The player is both creator and creation, experiencing reality from multiple levels of being.
