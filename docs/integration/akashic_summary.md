# AKASHIC LOADER - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## What is Akashic Loader?
A memory and testing system that ensures your Universal Being game runs at 60 FPS with infinite ZIP packages.

## Core Features:
1. **Smart Memory Management** - 50 active packages, 100MB cache, LRU eviction
2. **Package Validation** - Tests before loading to prevent crashes  
3. **Async Loading** - Never blocks the main thread
4. **Pentagon Integration** - Hooks into all 5 lifecycle phases
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time FPS and memory tracking

## Integration Points:
- **Pentagon**: Lifecycle-aware loading and cleanup
- **Connector**: DNA-driven package requirements
- **ZipPackageManager**: Enhanced with validation layer

## Performance Guarantees:
- ✅ 60 FPS maintained with 2ms/frame loading budget
- ✅ Automatic throttling when FPS drops
- ✅ Preloading for smooth evolution transitions
- ✅ Memory warnings before hitting limits

## Quick Usage:
```gdscript
var akashic = AkashicLoader.new()
akashic.queue_package_load("package.ub.zip", PRIORITY_HIGH)
akashic.preload_being_dependencies(being)
var metrics = akashic.get_performance_metrics()
```

## Why It Matters:
Without Akashic Loader, loading hundreds of ZIP packages would:
- Cause frame drops and stuttering
- Lead to memory crashes
- Make evolution transitions jarring
- Create unpredictable performance

With Akashic Loader, your game scales infinitely while maintaining smooth 60 FPS gameplay.

**The Akashic Records never forget, but they always perform!**
