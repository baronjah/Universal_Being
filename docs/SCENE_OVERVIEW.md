# Universal Being Scene Overview

This guide summarizes the three most complete scenes shipped with the project. Each scene showcases different aspects of the Universal Being vision.

## PERFECT_ULTIMATE_UNIVERSAL_BEING.tscn
* Massive demo integrating all major systems: cosmic LOD, matrix streaming, lightweight terrain and Gemma AI. Use the trackball camera to explore the infinite multiverse.
* Press **F1–F9** to test optimization and AI functions.

## 3D_NOTEPAD_GAME.tscn
* Former main scene focused on the 5‑layer floating notepad system with interactive words, asteroid mining and a holographic terminal.
* Demonstrates Gemma Vision, infinite terrain chunks and consciousness evolution.

## COSMIC_NOTEPAD_COMPLETE.tscn
* Archived concept (not committed in the repo) combining the notepad universe with full cosmic features.
* Serves as a reference design for merging notepad mechanics with the perfect ultimate scene.

### Integration Idea
Start from **PERFECT_ULTIMATE_UNIVERSAL_BEING.tscn** and selectively merge notepad features from the other scenes. This keeps the strong cosmic foundation while adding keyboard input, floating layers and word interactions.

## UNIVERSAL_BEING_GAME.tscn
* Unified scene that instantiates the **PERFECT_ULTIMATE_UNIVERSAL_BEING** environment, **3D_NOTEPAD_GAME** mechanics and the **CLEAN_3D_PROGRAMMING** playground.

* Now set as the project's main scene so that all major systems load by default.

* Serves as an experimental sandbox where all major systems run together.
