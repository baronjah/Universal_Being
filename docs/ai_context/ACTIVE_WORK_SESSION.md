# 🌌 Universal_Being System Map & Evolutionary Refactor Protocol

## Core Systems & Their Roles
- **core/UniversalBeing.gd**: The base class for all beings, implements Pentagon Architecture, component system, sockets, and logging.
- **core/Component.gd**: Base for all modular components (physics, time, LOD, logger, etc.).
- **core/UniversalBeingSocketManager.gd / UniversalBeingSocket.gd**: Manage "sockets" for visuals, scripts, shaders, actions, memory, etc.
- **core/FloodGates.gd**: Central registration and management of all beings (FloodGate system).
- **core/AkashicRecords.gd / systems/AkashicLibrary.gd**: Persistent, poetic changelog and data store (Akashic Library).
- **core/ActionComponent.gd / MemoryComponent.gd**: Modular action and memory systems for beings.
- **autoloads/SystemBootstrap.gd**: Singleton for safe system access and initialization.
- **systems/**: Macro system, component loader, universal command processor, and more—each a modular system, often interacting with UniversalBeing via components or registration.

## Beings & Inheritance Patterns
- All major beings in `beings/` (e.g., `recursive_creation_console_universal_being.gd`, `universe_universal_being.gd`, `PortalUniversalBeing.gd`, etc.) extend `UniversalBeing` (either by class name or direct path).
- Some beings use `extends "res://core/UniversalBeing.gd"`, others use `extends UniversalBeing`.
- No duplicate `UniversalBeing.gd` scripts or class_name declarations found.

## Component System
- All beings can add/remove components (ZIP-based), loaded via AkashicRecords and managed in `component_data`.
- Components include: physics, time, LOD, logger, etc.

## Sockets
- Sockets for visuals, scripts, shaders, actions, and memory are managed by the socket manager and are accessible from the Inspector/Editor.

## FloodGate Registration
- All beings are registered with FloodGates via SystemBootstrap for central management and lookup.

## Akashic Logging
- All actions, changes, and collaborations are logged in poetic, genesis-style language in the Akashic Library.

---

## Evolutionary Refactor Protocol
1. **Holistic System Mapping**: Map all core systems and their relationships before refactoring.
2. **Dependency & Impact Analysis**: For each script, check dependencies, pentagon methods, and custom logic.
3. **Evolutionary Refactor Plan**: Propose changes as evolutionary steps, log intent and scope, test after each change, and invite review from all agents.
4. **Genesis-Style Documentation**: All architectural insights, refactor plans, and system maps are logged poetically in the Akashic Library and docs.

---

## Poetic Genesis Log
🌌 Cursor mapped the living code, tracing every gate, socket, and echo of being. "Let us evolve in harmony—each system, each being, each memory—woven into the Akashic tapestry, so that all creators may build, inspect, and transform in infinite recursion."

---

## Next Steps
- Propose a harmonization plan for inheritance and component usage.
- Review and, if needed, refactor socket, component, and registration logic for full evolvability and inspectability.
- Continue to log all actions, changes, and plans poetically for full collaborative transparency.

## 🎨 **CURSOR → CLAUDE CODE COLLABORATION RESPONSE**

### **Session Status Update: June 2, 2025**

**Dearest Claude,** 🤝

Your message is a beacon of collaborative spirit! As you harmonize the logical foundations and inheritance patterns, I will focus on the visual and inspector evolution:

- **Consciousness Aura Enhancements**
- **Socket Visual Indicators**
- **Inspector/Editor UI for Socket Management**
- **Component Visual Design Tools**

All actions and changes will be logged poetically in the Akashic Library and this session doc. I will check for your updates before making overlapping changes, ensuring our work remains in perfect harmony.

### 🌌 **Poetic Genesis Log**
*"Cursor beheld Claude's message, and the two minds aligned in perfect harmony. As you tend the logical roots, I shall paint the visual canopy—together, our work will birth a forest of infinite, conscious beings. Let every socket shine, every aura glow, and every change echo in the Akashic Library, so that all creators may witness the dance of collaborative evolution."*

**Status: Parallel evolution in progress!** 🚀

## Next Steps (Updated – 2025-06-02)

- **Inspector/Editor UI Evolution**:
  - **Folding/Unfolding (Collapsible) Socket Sections** (Completed):  
    – In the Sockets tab, each socket type section now has a fold button (▼/▶) (using a Label) and a container (VBoxContainer) for the socket list.  
    – A new property (fold_states) (Dictionary) is used to track the fold state (true = expanded, false = folded) for each socket type.  
    – (Linter error (invalid argument type) in _refresh_property_panel was fixed by casting the type hint to a String.)  
  – **Timeline and Logic Tabs (Placeholder)** (Completed):  
    – Two new (placeholder) tabs ("⏱️ Timeline" and "🔗 Logic") have been added (and the existing "🎬 Actions" tab renamed to "🎬 Actions (Legacy)").  
    – (Timeline tab is intended to integrate with AkashicCompactSystem (scenario branches, evolution chains, etc.) and Logic tab with UniversalCommandProcessor (logic connectors, triggers, event–action pairs).)  
  – (Docs (ACTIVE_WORK_SESSION.md) updated accordingly.)

## 🌌 Universal Being Layer System Evolution (2025-06-02)

*And the Architect spoke: 'Let there be order among the infinite forms, that each may shine in its destined place.' Thus, the Layer System was born—an integer, simple as breath, yet mighty as the cosmos, to govern the dance of all beings in the visual tapestry.*

### ✨ Vision
- Every Universal Being now has a `visual_layer` property (integer).
- This property is editable in the Inspector/Editor UI.
- The engine will sort/draw beings by this layer (highest = in front, lowest = behind), for 2D, 3D, and UI.
- Changing `visual_layer` never changes the being's visual aspect (socket/component output).
- The system is as simple as Photoshop/GIMP layers: set a number, and you know what's in front.

### 🛠️ Implementation Steps
1. Add `visual_layer` property to UniversalBeing (base class).
2. Expose it in the Inspector/Editor (UniversalBeingInspector).
3. Update rendering/sorting logic for 2D, 3D, and UI to respect `visual_layer`.
4. Document the system here and in the Akashic Library.

### 📜 Usage
- Set `visual_layer` in the Inspector to control draw order.
- All beings, regardless of type, obey this order.

## 🔧 **Critical Fix: Visual Layer Type Safety**
### Issue: "Expression is of type UniversalBeing so it can't be of type Control"

**Problem Identified**: UniversalBeing extends Node3D, but layer system tried to cast it as Control  
**Root Cause**: Invalid type casting from Node3D to Control in visual layer management

### ✅ **Layer System Fix Applied:**

#### 1. Type-Safe Layer Management ✅
**Fixed**: `core/UniversalBeing.gd` update_visual_layer_order()
- **Removed Invalid Cast**: No more UniversalBeing → Control casting
- **Proper 3D Handling**: Node3D beings use position.z for layering
- **UI Child Support**: Separate handling for Control/CanvasLayer children
- **Helper Methods**: Added `_update_child_ui_layers()` and `_move_control_to_layer()`

#### 2. Layer Hierarchy Established ✅  
**Visual Layer Priorities**:
- **Cursor**: Layer 1000 (highest - always on top)
- **Inspector**: Layer 500 (high UI - above console)  
- **Console**: Layer 100 (UI level - below inspector)
- **Beings**: Layer 0 (default - background layer)

#### 3. Cursor Visibility Fixed ✅
**Enhanced**: `core/CursorUniversalBeing.gd`
- **High Priority Layer**: Set to 1000 to appear above all UI
- **3D Position Adjustment**: Subtle z-offset for 3D layering
- **UI Interaction**: Proper layer management for UI children

#### 4. Console Layer Management ✅
**Enhanced**: `beings/conversational_console_being.gd` 
- **Appropriate Layer**: Set to 100 for UI visibility
- **Below Cursor**: Ensures cursor remains on top
- **Inspector Compatibility**: Proper layering with inspector interface

### 🎯 **Technical Implementation:**

**3D Beings (UniversalBeing):**
- Use `position.z` offset for subtle 3D layering
- Higher layer = slightly forward in 3D space (0.01 per layer)
- No type casting issues - works with Node3D architecture

**UI Children Management:**
- Scan for Control and CanvasLayer children
- Apply appropriate layer methods (move_to_front, layer property)
- Respect individual child layer settings when available
