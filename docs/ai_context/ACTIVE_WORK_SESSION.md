# Active Work Session - Fixing Parse Errors

## Current Task: Making Universal_Being Playable
**Started:** June 03, 2025
**AI:** Claude Desktop MCP

### Critical Issues Being Fixed:

1. **Docstring Errors** - GDScript doesn't support Python """ docstrings
   - Need to convert all """ docstrings to # comments
   - Affecting many files across the project

2. **Missing Parameter Names** - Several functions have incomplete signatures

3. **Function Signature Mismatches** - Parent/child signatures don't match

4. **Undefined Identifiers** - Variables not declared in scope

### Progress:
- [x] Fixed main.gd line 1038 docstring error
- [x] Fixed beings/claude_desktop_mcp_universal_being.gd - converted all """ to # comments
- [x] Fixed components/being_dna/BeingDNAComponent.gd - converted all """ to # comments
- [x] Fixed core/CameraUniversalBeing.gd - converted all """ to # comments
- [x] Fixed systems/input_focus_manager.gd - converted all """ to # comments
- [x] Fixed ui/SceneDNAInspector.gd - converted all """ to # comments
- [x] All critical parse errors fixed! ðŸŽ‰
- [x] Fixed reserved keyword issues (trait, class_name) - June 03, 2025
- [x] Fixed BeingDNAComponent.gd Vector3 to Vector2 conversion issue
- [x] Fixed AICollaborationHub.gd log_system_event calls (wrong argument count)
- [x] Fixed recursive_creation_console_universal_being.gd log_system_event call
- [x] Fixed AkashicLibrary.gd docstring
- [x] **Game is now running!** ðŸŽ®
- [x] Fixed UniversalBeingDNA.gd Array[String] type mismatches
- [x] Fixed main.gd freed instance errors with validity checks
- [x] Added cleanup_demo_beings() function to remove freed instances
- [ ] Fix remaining docstrings in UniversalBeingDNA.gd
- [ ] Document all changes in Akashic Library

### Testing Results (June 03, 2025):
1. **Array Type Issues Fixed**:
   - `_calculate_preferred_states()` - Now returns proper Array[String]
   - `_identify_transcendence_markers()` - Now returns proper Array[String]

2. **Freed Instance Protection**:
   - All `demo_beings` iterations now check `is_instance_valid()`
   - Added `cleanup_demo_beings()` function called periodically
   - Prevents "Cannot call method on freed instance" errors

3. **Game Running Smoothly**:
   - Console creation/destruction works without crashes
   - Being evolution and state transitions working
   - AI collaboration active
   - Auto startup sequence successful

### Remaining Non-Critical Issues:
- Many docstrings in UniversalBeingDNA.gd still need conversion
- Some debug scripts have syntax errors
- Missing function implementations in chunk system

### Next Steps:
1. Fix parse errors in critical startup files
2. Ensure SystemBootstrap and GemmaAI autoloads work
3. Test basic game functionality
4. Create genesis log entry for this repair work
