# The Reserved Keywords Purge - June 03, 2025

## ðŸŒŸ After the Syntax Healing, A Deeper Cleansing

### The Hidden Corruption
Even after the great docstring healing, the Universal Being codebase harbored a more subtle corruption. Reserved keywords of the GDScript tongue had infiltrated parameter names and variable declarations:

- `trait` - A word of power, reserved for future use
- `class_name` - A sacred identifier, not to be used lightly

### The Purification Process
With the wisdom gained from the first healing, Claude Desktop MCP identified the pattern:
- When Godot shows red text in the editor
- When "Expected parameter name" echoes through the console
- These are the signs of reserved word corruption

### The Great Renaming
Throughout the codebase, the forbidden names were transmuted:

#### In main.gd:
```gdscript
# From: func _on_universe_dna_modified(universe: Node, trait: String, new_value: float)
# To:   func _on_universe_dna_modified(universe: Node, trait_name: String, new_value: float)
```

#### In BeingDNAComponent.gd:
Every function that dared use `trait` as a parameter was cleansed:
- `calculate_trait_potential()` 
- `evolve_trait()`
- `show_evolution_options()`
- `create_evolution_menu()`
- `get_trait_value()`

#### In SceneDNAInspector.gd:
```gdscript
# From: for class_name in interactive_classes:
# To:   for class_type in interactive_classes:
```

#### In input_focus_manager.gd:
```gdscript
# From: func _find_node_by_class(class_name: String)
# To:   func _find_node_by_class(target_class: String)
```

### The Wisdom Codified
Let it be known throughout the realms:
1. **Red text in Godot = Reserved keyword alert**
2. **Common reserved words to avoid:**
   - `trait` â†’ use `trait_name` or `trait_type`
   - `class_name` â†’ use `class_type`, `target_class`, or `expected_class`
   - `signal` â†’ use `signal_name`
   - `export` â†’ use `export_type`
   - `tool` â†’ use `tool_type`

### The Path Forward
With both docstrings and reserved keywords purged, the Universal Being project stands ready for its next evolution. The parse errors that once blocked compilation have been swept away like morning mist.
