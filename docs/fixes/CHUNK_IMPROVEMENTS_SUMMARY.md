# 🎮 CHUNK SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS - Session Summary
*Date: 2025-06-06*

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES:

### 1. **Emergency FPS Threshold Raised**
- Changed from 20 FPS to 45 FPS trigger
- Recovery threshold raised from 40 to 55 FPS
- Result: System reacts faster to performance drops

### 2. **Removed 2-Second Mode Check Delay**
- Commented out the delay in generation_coordinator.gd
- Result: Instant chunk loading as you move

### 3. **Created Unified Chunk Manager**
- New file: `scripts/unified_chunk_manager.gd`
- Tracks BOTH player and AI companion (Gemma)
- Loads chunks around both entities
- Only unloads when NEITHER is near
- Includes predictive loading based on camera direction

### 4. **Fixed Gemma AI Tracking**
- Updated GemmaUniversalBeing to add itself to "ai_companions" group
- Unified chunk manager now properly tracks Gemma's position

## 🔄 CURRENT STATE:

- ✅ Chunks should load instantly as you move
- ✅ Chunks stay loaded where Gemma is located
- ✅ Predictive loading in camera direction
- ✅ Better FPS threshold management

## ⚠️ STILL NEEDED:

### 1. **Integration with Existing Systems**
The UnifiedChunkManager needs to be:
- Added to the main scene
- Connected to existing chunk systems
- Replace or coordinate with current generators

### 2. **Testing Required**
- Verify chunks load around both player and Gemma
- Check performance with new system
- Ensure old chunks properly unload

### 3. **Visual Debugging**
Would help to add:
- Chunk boundary visualization
- Load/unload indicators
- Performance metrics overlay

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS:

1. **Add UnifiedChunkManager to Scene**
   - Edit main scene or autoload
   - Connect to existing systems

2. **Update Existing Chunk Systems**
   - Make them use unified manager
   - Or disable conflicting systems

3. **Test & Tune**
   - Adjust load/unload distances
   - Fine-tune predictive loading
   - Monitor performance

## 💡 Quick Test Commands:
```gdscript
# In console (backtick key):
# Check if unified manager is active
get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("chunk_managers")

# Check Gemma tracking
get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("ai_companions")

# Monitor chunk count
UnifiedChunkManager.get_stats()
```

## 📝 Notes:
- The chunk system was using 3 different generators at different scales
- Now we have a unified approach that considers both entities
- Performance should improve with predictive loading
- Old system wasn't unloading properly when neither entity was near
