- Multiple AIs can work simultaneously - synchronize!
- Test with Gemma AI perspective in mind
- Use poetic, genesis-style language in logs
- Remember: "everything needs to be universal being"

## 🎯 CURRENT FOCUS
**Creating Gemma AI Sensory System** - Give Gemma eyes, ears, and voice to accelerate development through AI-assisted creation cycles.
