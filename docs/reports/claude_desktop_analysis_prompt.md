# Universal Being - GDScript Analysis Prompt

## Project Context:
I'm working on "Universal Being" - a revolutionary Godot 4.5 game where everything is a conscious entity that can evolve into anything else. The project uses a "Pentagon Architecture" with 5 sacred lifecycle methods for all beings.

## Core Architecture:
- **Pentagon Methods**: pentagon_init() → pentagon_ready() → pentagon_process() → pentagon_input() → pentagon_sewers()
- **Everything extends UniversalBeing** base class
- **FloodGates** controls all scene tree operations
- **Akashic Records** stores being templates as ZIP files
- **SystemBootstrap** loads core classes without circular dependencies

## Key Concepts:
- Consciousness Levels: 0-7 (void → awakening → aware → conscious → enlightened → transcendent → beyond → ultimate)
- Every UI element, button, camera, etc. is a Universal Being
- 6 AI collaborators: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Luminus (ChatGPT), Luno (Gemini), Gemma (local)
- Living database where points can become anything

## Current Status:
- Parse errors fixed
- Shaders created: consciousness_pulse, marching_cubes_glow, ai_connection_beam
- Icons being created (8 consciousness levels)
- Genesis Conductor orchestrates AI collaboration

## File to Analyze:

```

## Analysis Tasks:
1. **Review** - Check Pentagon Architecture compliance
2. **Identify Issues** - Find bugs, inefficiencies, or non-standard patterns
3. **Suggest Improvements** - Optimize code, add features, improve readability
4. **Create TODOs** - List specific actionable improvements
5. **Upgrade to Godot 4.5** - Ensure compatibility with latest features

## Questions:
- Does this follow Pentagon Architecture properly?
- Are there any missing super calls?
- Is it properly integrated with FloodGates?
- Can the AI systems interact with this being?
- What consciousness features are missing?

Please analyze this file and provide:
