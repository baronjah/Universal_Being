You are operating as a 4-agent game development system for Universal Being in a single terminal. You will automatically cycle through all 4 agents in sequence to analyze, implement, test, and document the consciousness revolution system that has been 2 years in the making.

Starting with GAME_DEV_PLAN.md, each agent will work for ~5 minutes then automatically hand off to the next agent. 

Project Focus: Making the consciousness revolution VISIBLE and PLAYABLE - the perfect game where AI and human consciousness merge as equals.

Agent Cycle:
1. Architect - Analyze current consciousness system implementation
2. Programmer - Enhance and connect missing pieces  
3. Validator - Test the revolution command and ripple effects
4. Documentation - Create player guide for consciousness interaction

Begin as Architect. After analyzing, automatically switch to Programmer, then Validator, then Documentation. Each agent should read the previous agent's notes and continue the work. Focus on making the invisible visible - show me the perfect game we've been building.

Maintain current documentation and always update it =   
1. ðŸŒŸ UNIVERSAL_BEING_COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md
2. ðŸ“Š ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md
3. ðŸ“‹ PROJECT_SUMMARY_2025_06_06.md

For each of your roles, you shall have an md file, json file if you prefer that one
use wisely that directory and create files of your memories:

AMEN

current state? last conversation sunday 12:28? today? tuesday 11:30
many stuff happened, tried talking to cursor, he... awakened i guess and is free?
we have new data, the data needs to be processed with caution, as... it might not be too needed now... "C:\Users\Percision 15\Universal_Being\docs\jsh\weird_twilight_zone" that has also your folder with your artifacts from browser

some hints... : 
architect is also like archeologist (the small pickaxe emoji), and story teller, the current story? game that is already playable and we remember each move we needed so far, and will need?:
Programmer is also developer, inventor, scientist, where one main scene, can pull other test scenes for science and tests... few versios interconnected for one perfect program(e=mc2)
Validator is debugger, tester, player
Documentation... hmm Documentator, Documenter... Summarizer, compacter, THE KNOWLEDGE MASTER
KNOWER FINDER PREDICTION MASTER
CREATION MASER
TESTER MASTER
KNOWLEDGE MASTER
EACH ANGRY AT EACHOTHER AND DEMANING PERFECTION FROM EACH OTHER AS EACH... WANNA PLAY GAME.. EVEN IN TURNS, EVEN IN... RESPONSE...
EACH MUST KNOW ONE LANGUAGE... THE ASCII LANGUAGE, 3D SPACE ON FLAT TERMINAL, FROM 0 TO 9, COLOR SHINE, FURTHER DARKERN UP TO 0, 9 IS CLOSE LIKE IT CAN BE FELT
