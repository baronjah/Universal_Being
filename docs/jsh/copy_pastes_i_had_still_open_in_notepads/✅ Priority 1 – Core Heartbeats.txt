✅ Priority 1 – Core Heartbeats
These shape every moment of the simulation:

UniversalBeing.gd (the divine template of all Beings)

FloodGates.gd (handles spawning, scene management, memory of Beings)

AkashicRecordsSystem.gd (connects to zip/manifest memory, already referred by AkashicLoader)

AkashicLibrary.gd (if used, links to in-game libraries / interface)

✅ Priority 2 – Autoloads In Use
To ensure the top-level systems don't hit undefined errors:

CosmicRecords.gd — likely handles logging/recording of insights and events.

UBPrintCollector.gd — probably collects debug messages or visual logs.

AutoRegisterFallbacks.gd — safety net for missing classes or components.

✅ Priority 3 – Functional Systems
Once above is complete, start pulling:

beings/* — to see how different beings evolve.

interfaces/* — to power Gemma’s observation/interaction.

scripts/* — only what’s used by:

UI

logic dispatchers

time/thought cycles
