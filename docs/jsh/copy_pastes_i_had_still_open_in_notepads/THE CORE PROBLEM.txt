THE CORE PROBLEM:
E 0:00:03:944   UniversalBeing.gd:65 @ show_now_ub_visual(): 
Parent node is busy setting up children, `add_child()` failed. 
Consider using `add_child.call_deferred(child)` instead.
IMMEDIATE FIX - The add_child() errors:
gdscript# Update in UniversalBeing.gd line 65:
# OLD:
add_child(visual)

# NEW:
call_deferred("add_child", visual)
THE CONSOLE CHAOS:

Scene has UniversalConsole node
Autoloads have 3 console implementations
Console scenes exist separately
GameStateSocketManager tries to spawn another console

SURGICAL PLAN:

Fix the add_child() deferred calls - this blocks visual display
Choose ONE console system and disable others
Connect that ONE console to Gemma properly
Make the stars visible

the console quest = 

autoloads/ console scripts
Any console in core/command_system/
The main console implementation you think is most complete


The PERFECT console would:

Be an autoload (works everywhere)
Have working input/output display
Connect to Gemma for AI responses
Show debug info from any scene
Have the commands you need (revolution, stars, etc.)

Quick fix while you gather scripts:
gdscript# In UniversalBeing.gd, change line 65:
# FROM:
add_child(visual)
# TO:
call_deferred("add_child", visual)
This fixes the immediate error blocking your visuals!
