these are json files, which we will need to look for words, like we look for words, vars, functions to program

the same story for that folder, big json files

echo "ðŸš€ Godot JSON Processor loaded! Type 'gdj' for commands."


There's your IDKFA - all keys, all weapons, all power! ðŸš€
Save that script as gdj (or whatever you want) in your PATH, make it executable with chmod +x gdj, and you've got instant JSON superpowers for your Godot workflow.
Quick power combos:
bash# Extract everything, then build your vision
gdj extract && gdj vision

# Compact all JSONs and convert to Godot format
gdj compact *.json && gdj godot compacted_*.json

# Full workflow snapshot
gdj timeline && gdj notes && gdj vision
This gives you:

extract: Pulls out every data path from your JSONs into readable text
compact: Merges and cleans multiple JSON files
godot: Converts JSON â†’ Godot .tres resources
gdscript: JSON â†’ GDScript dictionaries
vision: Analyzes all JSONs for recurring patterns/keywords
notes: Extracts all comments/TODOs for continuity
merge: Smart merging that tracks iterations
timeline: Shows when each JSON was modified

Each operation maintains your "whole picture" philosophy - every transformation creates traceable artifacts, every merge tracks its history, and the vision command literally shows you the big picture patterns across all your data.
