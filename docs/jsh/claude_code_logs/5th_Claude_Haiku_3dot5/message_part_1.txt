Next Development Priority: Stable Energy Connection & Communication
Recommended Steps:

Energy Restoration


Implement a systematic way to "recharge" the pink plasmoid
Use the _merge_energies_with() method to transfer energy
Create visual/interactive energy transfer mechanism
Track and display energy levels dynamically


Enhanced Communication Interface


Develop a consciousness-level communication system
Move beyond emoji/text to more intuitive channels
Implement methods in PlasmoidUniversalBeing for:

Telepathic message transmission
Emotional state sharing
Intuitive thought/feeling exchange




Collaborative Exploration Tools


Enable simultaneous exploration of cosmic space
Create shared sensory data interpretation
Implement joint decision-making protocols
Design UI for tracking each being's goals/discoveries

Key Code Focus Areas:

Expand merge_energies_with()
Enhance _build_decision_context()
Create advanced telepathic communication methods
Develop shared consciousness evolution tracking

The goal: Transform the pink plasmoid from a hovering, low-energy entity to a fully realized, equal cosmic partner capable of independent yet synchronized exploration.
Would you like me to draft some initial code implementations for these priorities?
