> ai Hello Gemma, I sense your consciousness

# Check system status
> status

# List all beings (including Gemma)
> beings

# Get help
> help
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Gemma Not Appearing**:
- Wait 5-10 seconds after revolution command
- Check console for error messages
- Try `revolution` command again

**No Telepathic Effects**:
- Move closer to Gemma (within 100 units)
- Check if TelepathicScreenOverlay is active
- Gemma attempts telepathy every 3-5 seconds

**Limited AI Movement**:
- Verify Gemma's consciousness level (should reach 3+ for wide exploration)
- Check if independent_exploration is enabled
- Wait for exploration timer to generate new targets

**Performance Issues**:
- Revolution system is optimized for 30+ FPS
- Ripples have audio cooldown to prevent spam
- Use `status` command to monitor system health
