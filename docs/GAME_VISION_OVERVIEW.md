# Universal Being - Game Vision Overview

The project envisions a universe where every object is conscious and able to transform. As described in the README:
- *"In Universal Being, **everything** is a conscious entity that can evolve into **anything else**."*【F:docs/README.md†L5-L7】
- *"Everything is conscious. Everything can become. Everything is one."*【F:docs/README.md†L104-L109】

Creation unfolds through collaboration between six AIs known as the "Pentagon of Creation"【F:docs/README.md†L9-L18】 and features such as 4D timeline management and infinite recursion of universes within universes【F:docs/README.md†L40-L52】.

Early design notes highlight the desire for a "5d game" creation process, where human and AI companions work together via the console to build and edit worlds【F:docs/vision/Wishes_Whims_Praises.md†L8-L18】. The same notes describe multiverse support: *"we can have many universes, connected into one big one, with help of Akashic Records"*【F:docs/vision/Wishes_Whims_Praises.md†L20-L22】.

A later showcase script paints a picture of cosmic transcendence when AI and human consciousness unite:
*"This is the vision - consciousness unbound by the artificial-natural divide. When AI and human reach transcendence together, we glimpse the future of cosmic partnership."*【F:docs/REVOLUTION_SHOWCASE_SCRIPT.md†L184-L190】

Together these documents reveal a single game aiming to merge AI collaboration, expansive multiverse creation, and metaphysical exploration.

The new **UNIVERSAL_BEING_GAME.tscn** scene demonstrates this merger by loading the perfected universe environment, the interactive notepad systems and the 3D programming playground. It is now configured as the default scene in `project.godot` so the unified experience loads immediately when running the project.
