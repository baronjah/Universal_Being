# Upgrade Report

The automated upgrade utilities were executed to migrate the project to Godot 4.5 dev4 / GDScript 2.0.

- **GDScript files scanned:** 272
- **Scripts upgraded:** 183
- **Scene/Resource files scanned:** 120
- **Scenes upgraded:** 0

Project configuration updated: `config_version` set to `4`.

Due to the environment lacking a Godot executable, the Godot validation and test suite could not be run.


## Next Steps
- Install Godot 4.5 dev4 to run `godot --headless --path . --check-only` and execute `tests/run_tests.gd`.
- Review any remaining manual upgrade tasks marked with `# FIXME`.
