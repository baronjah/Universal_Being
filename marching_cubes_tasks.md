# ðŸŽ® Marching Cubes + Universal Being

## What This Does:
Turns 3D noise into **living meshes** that can represent consciousness!

## Quick Setup:
1. Copy addon to `Universal_Being/addons/marching_cubes_viewer/`
2. Enable in Project Settings â†’ Plugins
3. Add MarchingCubesViewerGlsl node

## Consciousness as 3D Form:
```gdscript
# Level 0: Void (almost empty)
# Level 7: Complex sacred geometry

func update_3d_form(level: int):
    threshold = 0.5 - (level * 0.05)
    # Higher level = lower threshold = more complex form
```

## Visual Ideas:
- Being's "soul" = marching cubes mesh
- Being's "aura" = particle effects
- Evolution = smooth morphing between forms
- AI Network = shared consciousness field

## For Claude Code & Cursor:
Create test scene with:
- MarchingCubesViewerGlsl node
- Link to consciousness system
- Test morphing animation

This could make beings truly come alive in 3D!
