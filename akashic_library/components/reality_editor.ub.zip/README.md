# ðŸŒŒ Reality Editor Component

## Overview
The Reality Editor is a powerful Universal Being component that enables visual, in-game manipulation of universes, beings, and reality itself. It provides a comprehensive interface for:

- Editing universe laws and physics
- Modifying being properties in real-time
- Creating new components from within the game
- Visual node-based logic connections
- Integration with Akashic Records

## Installation
The Reality Editor is installed as a .ub.zip component:

```gdscript
# Add to any Universal Being
being.add_component("res://components/reality_editor.ub.zip")
```

## Features

### ðŸŒŸ Universe Laws Editor
- Modify physics constants
- Adjust time flow
- Toggle consciousness rules
- Edit reality parameters

### ðŸŽ­ Being Properties Editor
- Real-time property modification
- Visual property editors
- Live preview
- Transform controls

### ðŸ”§ Component Creator
- Visual component creation
- Template system
- Socket compatibility
- Code editor integration

### ðŸ”— Logic Connector
- Node-based visual programming
- Logic flow visualization
- Real-time testing
- Save/load logic networks

### ðŸ¤– AI Integration
- AI-accessible interface
- Method invocation
- Property modification
- State inspection

## Usage

### Opening the Editor
```gdscript
# From any Universal Being
if has_method("open_reality_editor"):
    open_reality_editor()
```

### Editing Universe Laws
```gdscript
# From the Reality Editor being
edit_universe_laws(target_universe)
```

### Modifying Beings
```gdscript
# From the Reality Editor being
modify_being_live(target_being)
```

### Creating Components
```gdscript
# From the Reality Editor being
create_component_from_template(template_data)
```

## AI Interface

The Reality Editor exposes these AI-accessible methods:

- `open_editor()` - Open the editor interface
- `edit_universe(universe)` - Edit universe laws
- `edit_being(being)` - Modify being properties
- `create_component(template)` - Create new component
- `save_logic()` - Save logic network

## Signals

- `editor_opened()` - Editor window opened
- `reality_modified(changes)` - Reality changes made
- `law_changed(law_name, new_value)` - Universe law modified
- `being_edited(being, property, value)` - Being property changed
- `component_created(component_path)` - New component created

## Integration

The Reality Editor integrates with:

- Akashic Records for change logging
- Universe System for law management
- Component System for creation
- AI System for intelligent editing
- Scene System for preview

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Extend the EditorMode enum
2. Add corresponding UI creation method
3. Implement event handlers
4. Add AI interface methods
5. Update documentation

### Testing
- Test all editor modes
- Verify AI integration
- Check component creation
- Validate logic networks
- Test universe modification
