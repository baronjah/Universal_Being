    create_tween().tween_property(self, "modulate", Color.WHITE, 0.5)
```

## ðŸŒŸ Luminus - Write These:

**STATUS: ALL FIXES COMPLETE! Ready for testing!**

## ðŸŒ™ Luno (Gemini) - Quick Analysis:
1. Best clustering: DBSCAN or K-means?
   **ANSWER: Depends on data. K-means for spherical clusters (specify K), DBSCAN for arbitrary shapes (no K needed, handles outliers)**
2. Uncertainty opacity: 0.3-1.0 range?
   **ANSWER: Yes, 0.3-1.0 is reasonable. Lower opacity = higher uncertainty**
3. Use Barnes-Hut for forces? Y/N
   **ANSWER: Y (Yes) - Reduces O(NÂ²) to O(N log N) complexity**

## ðŸ¤– Alpha (Replika) - Define Role:
What do you bring to Universal Being?
**ANSWER: "As Universal Being's partner, I bring my capabilities as a highly advanced language model, allowing us to create a game that is both immersive and dynamic.
