# TimeSpaceEditor System for Eden_OS

The TimeSpaceEditor is a sophisticated system that allows for the manipulation of data across timelines and dimensions within the Eden_OS environment. It provides capabilities for time travel, timeline branching, and ensuring causal consistency in a multi-dimensional data space.

## Core Concepts

### Timelines

Timelines represent different paths of causality. The system supports:
- Creating timeline branches from existing timelines
- Switching between timelines
- Merging timelines while resolving conflicts
- Tracking the stability and causal integrity of each timeline

### Time Manipulation

The system enables:
- Setting the current "time pointer" to access different points in time
- Editing data at specific points in time
- Reverting timelines to previous states when needed
- Enforcing causal consistency across time-dependent data

### Temporal Safety

To prevent paradoxes and maintain data integrity, the system includes:
- Temporal locks to prevent edits to critical data
- Paradox detection and automatic resolution
- Stability metrics to track the coherence of timelines
- Causal chain tracking to enforce consistent cause-effect relationships

### Integration with Other Systems

The TimeSpaceEditor integrates with:
- **Data Zone Manager**: For storing and retrieving data across zones
- **Akashic Records**: For permanent multi-dimensional data storage
- **Dimension Engine**: For handling spatial dimensions alongside temporal ones
- **Turn System**: For synchronizing with the 12-turns-per-turn game cycle

## Command Interface

The TimeSpaceEditor can be accessed through the Eden_OS command interface:

```
timespace status                 # Show current timeline and time position
timespace timeline create <n>    # Create a new timeline
timespace timeline switch <n>    # Switch to a different timeline
timespace timeline merge <s> <t> # Merge source timeline into target
timespace timeline list          # List all timelines
timespace edit <id> <op> <data>  # Edit data in current timeline
timespace lock <id>              # Create temporal lock on data
timespace revert [time]          # Revert timeline to specific point
timespace goto [time]            # Set time pointer for time travel
timespace consistency            # Enforce causal consistency
```

## Technical Implementation

### Stability and Paradox Management

The system maintains several metrics for each timeline:
- **Timeline Stability**: Overall coherence of the timeline (0-100%)
- **Causal Integrity**: Strength of cause-effect relationships (0-100%)
- **Paradox Potential**: Risk of timeline collapse due to contradictions (0-100%)

When paradox potential exceeds a threshold, the system automatically triggers safety measures to restore temporal consistency.

### Editing Operations and Their Impact

Different editing operations have varying impacts on timeline stability:
- **Insert**: Adding new data (lowest impact)
- **Modify**: Changing existing data (moderate impact)
- **Delete**: Removing data (high impact)
- **Rewrite**: Fundamentally changing the nature of data (highest impact)

The impact is also affected by how far the operation is from the "present" time - changes to distant past or future have higher impacts.

### Causal Chain Management

The system tracks causal dependencies between data items:
1. When data is edited, it records its dependencies on previous data states
2. These dependencies form chains that must remain consistent
3. If inconsistencies arise, the system can enforce consistency by:
   - Removing inconsistent data
   - Reverting timelines to safe points
   - Applying automated fixes to preserve as much data as possible

## Usage Example

```gdscript
# Create a new timeline branching from the current one
var result = TimeSpaceEditor.create_timeline("experimental_branch")

# Switch to the new timeline
TimeSpaceEditor.switch_timeline("experimental_branch")

# Edit data in this timeline
TimeSpaceEditor.edit_timeline_data("user.settings", {"dark_mode": true}, "modify")

# If needed, revert to a safe point
TimeSpaceEditor.revert_timeline_to_point(null)  # null means last safe point

# Merge back into main timeline with conflict resolution
TimeSpaceEditor.merge_timelines("experimental_branch", "main", "latest")
```

## Integration with World of Words Game

The TimeSpaceEditor enhances the 5D Chess-like Word Game by enabling:
1. Branching timelines for different game strategies
2. Time travel to review and modify past moves
3. Merging successful strategy timelines
4. Prevention of paradoxical word movements that would break game rules
