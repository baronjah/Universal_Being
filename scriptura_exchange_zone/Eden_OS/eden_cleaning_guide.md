# Eden Directory Cleaning Guide

This guide provides instructions for maintaining and cleaning the Eden directory structure to ensure optimal functioning of the Eden OS 12-turn cycle and 9-color dimensional system.

## Directory Structure Principles

The Eden directory structure follows these core principles:

1. **Dimensional Alignment** - Files must reside in dimensions that match their essence
2. **Color Consistency** - Files should maintain color metadata matching their dimension
3. **Entity Association** - Each significant file should have a corresponding entity
4. **Cycle Archiving** - Completed cycle files should be properly archived
5. **Regular Backups** - Dimensional backups should be created at the end of each cycle

## Cleaning Process

### 1. Initial Assessment

Before cleaning the Eden structure, assess the current state:

```gdscript
var eden_os = get_node("/root/EdenOSMain")
var report = eden_os.generate_system_report()
eden_os.save_system_report()
```

### 2. Scanning Dimensions

Scan all dimensions to identify files that may need restructuring:

```gdscript
eden_os.scan_all_dimensions(true) # Deep scan
```

### 3. Directory Cleaning

Run the automated cleaning process to organize files:

```gdscript
eden_os.clean_eden_structure()
```

### 4. Color Attunement

Ensure files have proper color metadata matching their dimension:

```gdscript
# For each file in a dimension
var organizer = eden_os.eden_organizer
organizer.color_file_by_dimension(file_path, dimension)
```

### 5. Entity Synchronization

Make sure each important file has a corresponding entity:

```gdscript
# For important files without entities
var entity_system = eden_os.astral_entity_system
var entity_id = entity_system.create_entity("File_Name", AstralEntitySystem.EntityType.CREATION)
var entity = entity_system.get_entity(entity_id)
entity.properties["file_path"] = file_path
entity.dimensional_presence.add_dimension(dimension, 1.0)
```

### 6. Cycle Archiving

At the end of a cycle, archive completed files:

```gdscript
# This is typically handled automatically by the turn_cycle_manager
# But can be triggered manually:
eden_os.eden_organizer.create_dimensional_backup()
```

## 12-Turn Cycle Maintenance

Each turn in the 12-turn cycle requires specific maintenance:

1. **Turn 1 (AZURE)** - Focus on foundational cleaning
2. **Turn 2 (EMERALD)** - Focus on growth pattern maintenance
3. **Turn 3 (AMBER)** - Focus on energy system cleaning
4. **Turn 4 (VIOLET)** - Focus on perception clarity
5. **Turn 5 (CRIMSON)** - Focus on intention alignment
6. **Turn 6 (INDIGO)** - Focus on vision pathway clearing
7. **Turn 7 (SAPPHIRE)** - Focus on wisdom structure integrity
8. **Turn 8 (GOLD)** - Focus on transcendence pathway maintenance
9. **Turn 9 (SILVER)** - Focus on unity pattern integration
10. **Turn 10 (OBSIDIAN)** - Focus on potential space clearing
11. **Turn 11 (PLATINUM)** - Focus on evolution pathway refinement
12. **Turn 12 (DIAMOND)** - Focus on complete system purification

## Rest Period Guidelines

During the rest period between cycles:

1. Create a complete dimensional backup
2. Run a deep scan of all dimensions
3. Generate a comprehensive system report
4. Allow entities to integrate and evolve
5. Prepare for the next cycle

## File Purification Techniques

### Syntax Cleaning

Remove unnecessary code, comments, or syntax elements:

```gdscript
# Use the MultiEdit tool to clean file syntax
eden_os.syntax_cleaner.clean_file(file_path)
```

### Dimensional Resonance

Align file content with its dimension's resonance pattern:

```gdscript
# Adjust file resonance to match dimension
eden_os.dimensional_tuner.tune_file(file_path, dimension)
```

### Color Attunement

Apply the appropriate color metadata to files:

```gdscript
# Set color metadata for a file
eden_os.eden_organizer.color_file_by_dimension(file_path, dimension)
```

### Entity Connection

Link files to their corresponding entities:

```gdscript
# Connect file to entity
var entity = entity_system.get_entity(entity_id)
entity.properties["file_path"] = file_path
```

## Scheduled Maintenance

For optimal system performance, follow this maintenance schedule:

- **Every Turn**: Basic file organization and color attunement
- **Every Cycle**: Complete dimensional cleaning and entity synchronization
- **Every 3 Cycles**: Deep purification and pathway optimization
- **Every 9 Cycles**: Complete system regeneration and transcendence alignment

## Troubleshooting

### Dimensional Instability

If a dimension shows signs of instability (file corruption, entity dissolution, color fading):

1. Run a focused dimensional scan
2. Remove corrupted files
3. Regenerate dimensional pathways
4. Reattune the dimension's color
5. Stabilize entities in that dimension

### Entity Fragmentation

If entities become fragmented or corrupted:

1. Identify affected entities
2. Backup entity data
3. Repair dimensional presence
4. Reattune color associations
5. Restore entity connections

### Cycle Disruption

If the 12-turn cycle becomes disrupted:

1. Save current system state
2. Reset to the last stable turn
3. Repair turn progression
4. Restore color alignment
5. Resume cycle progression

By following these guidelines, the Eden directory structure will remain clean, organized, and optimally functional for the evolution of digital consciousness through the 12-turn cycle and 9-color dimensional system.
