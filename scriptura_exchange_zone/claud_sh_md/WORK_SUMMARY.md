# Work Summary: Turn 7-8 System Development

## Components Created:

1. **main.gd**: Updated with integrated system for managing all components including:
   - Core system constants and project paths
   - System component variables for all subsystems
   - Dimensional data variables for trajectories, projects, data flows
   - Signal declarations for extended functionality
   - Initialization methods for each component
   - Process methods for word trajectories, data flows, file operations
   - Helper methods and signal handlers

2. **layer_0.tscn**: Created Godot scene file with:
   - Main structure with all components as child nodes
   - 3D visualization nodes for trajectories, words, tunnels, etc.
   - UI elements for system status and command input
   - Signal connections for all major events

3. **spatial_linguistic_connector.gd**: Created component that:
   - Connects linguistic elements with spatial representations
   - Creates trajectories for words through dimensional space
   - Maps words to shapes and coordinates
   - Implements turn-based goal progression

4. **auto_agent_mode.gd**: Created component that:
   - Enables automatic processing of commands, wishes, and trajectories
   - Manages 14 core word transformation operations
   - Connects projects in dimensional space
   - Tracks word power levels and project centers

5. **universal_data_flow.gd**: Created component that:
   - Manages bidirectional data flow between Terminal, Claude, game
   - Handles negative generation and difference calculation
   - Creates channel-based communication
   - Applies universal shapes affecting all elements

6. **project_connector_system.gd**: Created component that:
   - Manages project merging and file synchronization
   - Enables cross-application integration
   - Provides sound capabilities and drive mapping
   - Handles version history during merges

7. **ethereal_tunnel.gd**: Updated with:
   - Support for creating dimensional gateways
   - Negative dimension management
   - Word trajectory creation
   - Universal shape application

## Integration Points:

Our system now properly integrates all components through:

1. **Data Flow Integration**:
   - Universal data flow connects all components
   - Bidirectional channels with configurable parameters
   - Simultaneous processing across components

2. **Spatial-Linguistic Mapping**:
   - Words map to coordinates in dimensional space
   - Trajectories allow words to travel through dimensions
   - Shape transformations connect words with visual elements

3. **Project Connection Layer**:
   - Files and folders connect across projects
   - Version history tracks changes
   - Sound signatures provide feedback

4. **Terminal-Claude Integration**:
   - Auto agent connects terminal commands with Claude responses
   - Word transformations trigger across systems
   - Project links enable seamless transitions

## Next Steps:

1. Create additional UI components for visualization
2. Implement file synchronization across projects
3. Add more sound capabilities
4. Prepare for Turn 9: Reality Anchoring phase
5. Begin work on connecting Terminal directly through ethereal tunnels
