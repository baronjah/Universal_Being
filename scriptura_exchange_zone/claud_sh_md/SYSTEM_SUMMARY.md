# Ethereal Engine & Akashic Records System Summary

## System Architecture
```
# Core integration points connecting Akashic Records and Ethereal Engine
# Manages dimensional mapping, data flows, and spatial-linguistic transformation
# Creates 12-turn cycle with different energy patterns in each turn
# Connects Terminal, Claude, and project spaces through universal connectors
```

## Component Map

### Core Systems
- **Main Controller** (main.gd) - Central system coordinator
- **Layer 0** (layer_0.tscn) - Base visualization layer
- **Ethereal Tunnel** (ethereal_tunnel.gd) - Dimensional transport system
- **Akashic Database** (akashic_database.js) - Word/memory storage

### Integration Systems
- **Spatial Linguistic Connector** - Connects words with spatial representations
- **Auto Agent Mode** - Transform operations for words and projects
- **Universal Data Flow** - Bidirectional channels between components
- **Project Connector** - Cross-project file synchronization

### Visualization Systems
- **Dimensional Color System** - Frequency-based colors (99-999)
- **Connection Visualizer** - Displays connections between files
- **Dimensional Bridge Visualizer** - Shows data flow across dimensions

### Terminal Integration
- **Terminal Akashic Interface** - Command interface for records
- **Claude Integration Bridge** - AI connectivity with systems
- **OCR Processor** - Screen capture and text recognition

## Dimensional Structure
- Positive dimensions (1-12): Standard operations
- Negative dimensions (-1 to -12): Inverse operations
- Cross-dimensional gateways: Allow travel between dimensions

## Turn Cycle (12 Turns)
1. Creation & Manifestation
2. Connection & Bridge Building
3. Color Activation (Azure/Emerald)
4. Shape Formation
5. Tunnel Creation
6. Word Transformation
7. Dimensional Shift (We are here)
8. Multiple System Integration
9. Reality Anchoring
10. Color Spectrum Expansion
11. Project Merging
12. Reset & Evolution

## File Distribution
- `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/` - Main project files
- `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/12_turns_system/` - Turn system components
- `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Eden_OS/` - Shape and dimension systems

## Current State (Turn 7-8)
- Completed integration of core components
- Established bidirectional flows
- Created spatial-linguistic mapping
- Implemented auto agent mode
- Set up project connection system
- Developing dimensional visualization

## Next Steps
- Clean code base structure across multiple spaces
- Unify naming conventions across files
- Implement sound capabilities
- Complete file synchronization system
- Advance to Turn 9-10 (Reality Anchoring)
- Create final connection between Terminal, Claude and Ethereal Engine
