# Compact Ethereal Tunnel System

The Ethereal Tunnel System provides a framework for connecting different parts of a project through dimensional pathways. This system visualizes connections between components as interactive 3D tunnels with varying properties based on dimensional characteristics.

## Core Concepts

### Dimensional Anchors
Each project component is represented as a "dimensional anchor" in 3D space. These anchors serve as connection points for tunnels and have the following properties:
- Unique ID
- 3D coordinates
- Type (core, module, service, interface, storage)

### Ethereal Tunnels
Tunnels connect anchors and represent data pathways with the following properties:
- Source and target anchors
- Dimension (1-9)
- Stability (affected by dimensional differences)
- Energy requirements for transfers
- Color spectrum based on dimension

### Turn System
The system operates on a 12-turn cycle, with each turn having specific effects:
1. **Origin**: Base dimension boost and energy regeneration
2. **Flow**: Improved tunnel stability and transfer speed
3. **Expansion**: Increased tunnel capacity
4. **Convergence**: Enhanced connection capabilities
5. **Reflection**: Word resonance amplification
6. **Diminution**: Accelerated energy recovery
7. **Elevation**: Higher dimension access with stability cost
8. **Insight**: Increased word power
9. **Reverberation**: Improved tunnel durability
10. **Crystallization**: Better energy efficiency
11. **Manifestation**: Word materialization boost
12. **Transition**: Dimension shift potential

### Energy System
Operations require energy, which regenerates over time. Different operations have different costs:
- Establishing tunnels (based on distance and dimension)
- Transferring data through tunnels (based on content size)
- Shifting dimensions
- Maintaining tunnels in dimensions different from the current one

## Component Overview

- Current dimension indicator
- Turn cycle tracking
- Transfer progress monitoring
- Status messaging
- Interactive controls for system management

## Usage

### Establishing Connections
Create tunnels between anchors to establish connections between components. Higher-dimensional tunnels can transfer more complex data but require more energy and are less stable when the system is in a different dimension.

### Dimensional Shifts
Shift between dimensions to optimize different aspects of the system:
- Lower dimensions (1-3): More stable, less energy intensive
- Middle dimensions (4-6): Balanced stability and capability
- Higher dimensions (7-9): Enhanced capabilities but less stable and more energy intensive

### Data Transfers
Transfer data through tunnels with considerations for:
- Tunnel stability (affects transfer time and energy cost)
- Current dimension (affects tunnel stability)
- Turn effects (can improve transfer speed or reduce costs)

### Turn Management
Advance turns strategically to benefit from different effects:
- Use Turn 5 (Diminution) when energy is low
- Use Turn 7 (Insight) when working with word systems
- Use Turn 9 (Reverberation) when maintaining many tunnels
- Use Turn 11 (Transition) when preparing for dimension shifts

## Integration with Existing Systems

The Ethereal Tunnel System can connect with:
- Word manifestation systems (for semantic transfers)
- File systems (for content transfers)
- Terminal bridges (for command routing)
- Dimensional processors (for complex transformations)
- Akashic records (for persistent storage)

## Visualization Controls

The 3D visualization provides:
- Interactive camera controls
- Selectable tunnels and anchors
- Visual indicators for tunnel stability
- Warning effects for at-risk tunnels
- Particle effects for active transfers
- Automatic level-of-detail adjustments

## Quick Start

1. Add the scene to your project
2. Register your component anchors
3. Establish tunnels between related components
4. Use the controller to manage energy and turns
5. Transfer data through established tunnels

Example code:
```gdscript
# Register a component anchor
tunnel_manager.register_anchor("my_component", Vector3(1, 2, 3), "module")

# Establish a tunnel
tunnel_controller.establish_tunnel("my_component", "other_component")

# Transfer data
tunnel_controller.transfer_through_tunnel("my_component_to_other_component", "Sample data")

# Advance turn
tunnel_controller.advance_turn()

# Shift dimension
tunnel_controller.shift_dimension(5)
```
