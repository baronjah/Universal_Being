# Akashic Records Game System

A comprehensive framework for integrating Godot games with the Akashic Records system, allowing for cross-dimensional data persistence, ethereal memory transfer, and dimensional gameplay mechanics.

## Overview

The Akashic Records Game System provides a complete solution for building games that can interact with the Akashic Records - a universal data storage and retrieval system that spans across dimensions, timelines, and physical/virtual drives. This system enables games to:

1. **Persist data across dimensions** - Save game states that can be accessed from different dimensions
2. **Synchronize data across multiple drives** - Keep game data consistent across local, cloud, and ethereal storage
3. **Adapt gameplay based on dimensions** - Change game mechanics and visuals based on the current dimension
4. **Track player actions in the Akashic Records** - Record player activities for later retrieval and analysis
5. **Integrate with the turn-based system** - Tie game mechanics to the 12-turn system

## Core Components

### 1. AkashicRecordsGameConnector

```
/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/akashic_records_game_connector.gd
```

The primary bridge between games and the Akashic Records system. This component manages:

- Game state saving/loading
- Cross-drive synchronization
- Dimension-aware data persistence
- Communication with the Akashic Records
- Memory fragment management

Key methods:
- `initialize_game(game_id, name, version)` - Set up the game in the Akashic system
- `save_game_state(state_data, save_id, slot)` - Save game state
- `load_game_state(save_id, slot)` - Load game state
- `change_dimension(new_dimension)` - Switch to different dimension
- `create_game_object_record(object_data, object_type)` - Create object in Akashic Records
- `record_player_action(action_type, action_data)` - Record player activities

### 2. AkashicGameFramework

```
/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/akashic_game_framework.gd
```

A high-level framework that integrates all aspects of the Akashic system into a cohesive game management system:

- Game initialization and configuration
- Player data management
- Level management
- Action tracking and handling
- Dimensional effects application
- Turn-based mechanics integration
- Debug capabilities

Key methods:
- `initialize_game(game_id, game_name, game_version, author)` - Initialize the game
- `save_game(slot, description)` - Save the current game state
- `load_game(save_id, slot)` - Load a game state
- `change_dimension(new_dimension)` - Change the current dimension
- `register_game_object(object_id, object_data, type)` - Register an object
- `record_player_action(action_type, action_data)` - Record player action
- `change_level(level_id)` - Change the current game level

### 3. Game Template

```
/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/akashic_game_template/main.gd
```

A ready-to-use template for new games that want to integrate with the Akashic system. Includes:

- Full integration with the AkashicGameFramework
- Signal connections and handlers
- Action handling implementations
- Dimensional effects implementation
- Level management
- UI integration
- Debug capabilities

## Dimensional System

The Akashic Game System supports 9 dimensions, each with unique properties:

1. **Foundation** - Basic physical rules and structures
2. **Growth** - Biological and developmental patterns
3. **Energy** - Power flows and force dynamics
4. **Insight** - Information and knowledge systems
5. **Force** - Advanced physics and control
6. **Vision** - Perception and awareness
7. **Wisdom** - Integration of knowledge systems
8. **Transcendence** - Beyond physical limitations
9. **Unity** - All dimensions combined

Games can adapt their mechanics, visuals, and rules based on the current dimension. The system automatically handles persistence across dimensional boundaries.

## Turn System Integration

The framework integrates with the 12-turn system, allowing games to:

- Track the current turn
- Apply turn-specific effects
- Save/load state based on turns
- Implement mechanics that evolve over the turn cycle

## Cross-Drive System

Game data can be synchronized across multiple storage drives:

- **LOCAL** - On the current device
- **NETWORK** - Shared network locations
- **CLOUD** - Cloud storage services
- **VIRTUAL** - Virtual drives (Eden_OS, LuminusOS)
- **ETHEREAL** - Non-physical dimensional storage

The system handles automatic synchronization, conflict resolution, and ensures data integrity across all connected drives.

## Implementation Guide

### Basic Setup

1. Create a new Godot project
2. Copy the following files to your project:
   - `akashic_records_game_connector.gd`
   - `akashic_game_framework.gd`
3. Create a main scene with a structure similar to the template:
   ```
   - Main (Node)
     - AkashicGameFramework (AkashicGameFramework)
     - GameWorld (Node2D or Node3D)
     - GameUI (Control)
     - DimensionalEffects (Node)
   ```
4. Attach the main script based on the template

### Saving and Loading

To save a game:

```gdscript
# Update player data in the framework
game_framework.player_data.position = player.position
game_framework.player_data.health = player.health

# Register custom game objects if needed
game_framework.register_game_object("level_progress", {
    "completed_objectives": completed_objectives,
    "unlocked_areas": unlocked_areas
})

# Save the game
var save_id = game_framework.save_game(slot_number, "Manual save")
```

To load a game:

```gdscript
# Load from a slot
var success = game_framework.load_game("", slot_number)

if success:
    # Apply loaded data to game state
    player.position = game_framework.player_data.position
    player.health = game_framework.player_data.health
    
    # Get custom game objects
    var progress = game_framework.get_game_object("level_progress")
    if progress:
        completed_objectives = progress.completed_objectives
        unlocked_areas = progress.unlocked_areas
```

### Changing Dimensions

To change the current dimension:

```gdscript
# Switch to dimension 5 (Force)
game_framework.change_dimension(5)

# Apply visual effects based on the new dimension
update_visuals_for_dimension(game_framework.game_state.current_dimension)

# Adjust gameplay mechanics based on dimension
adjust_mechanics_for_dimension(game_framework.game_state.current_dimension)
```

### Recording Player Actions

```gdscript
# Record when player collects an item
game_framework.record_player_action("collect_item", {
    "item_id": item.id,
    "item_name": item.name,
    "item_value": item.value,
    "position": item.position
})

# Record when player completes a level
game_framework.record_player_action("level_complete", {
    "level_id": current_level,
    "completion_time": level_timer,
    "score": current_score,
    "perfect": no_damage_taken
})
```

## Advanced Features

### Ethereal Transfers

For high-dimensional transfers (dimensions 7-9), the system uses ethereal transfers which can move data through dimensional barriers. These are especially useful for transcendent game elements:

```gdscript
# Set the save drive to ethereal
akashic_records_connector.set_default_save_drive(DriveType.ETHEREAL)

# Save to ethereal drive
var save_id = game_framework.save_game(-1, "Ethereal save")

# Change to another dimension
game_framework.change_dimension(8)

# Load from ethereal drive
game_framework.load_game(save_id)
```

### Dimensional Effects

Each dimension can have unique effects on gameplay and visuals:

```gdscript
func apply_dimensional_effects(dimension):
    match dimension:
        1: # Foundation
            player.gravity_scale = 1.0
            world_shader.set_parameter("distortion", 0.0)
            
        4: # Insight
            # Reveal hidden objects
            for item in hidden_items:
                item.visible = true
            world_shader.set_parameter("insight_glow", 1.0)
            
        8: # Transcendence
            # Allow player to pass through certain barriers
            player.collision_mask = transcendent_collision_mask
            world_shader.set_parameter("transparency", 0.7)
```

### Turn-Based Mechanics

Implement mechanics that change with the turn cycle:

```gdscript
func _on_turn_changed(old_turn, new_turn):
    # Apply turn-specific effects
    match new_turn:
        1: # Beginning turn
            world_energy = 0.7
            enemy_spawn_rate = 0.5
            
        6: # Middle turn
            world_energy = 1.0
            enemy_spawn_rate = 1.0
            
        12: # Final turn
            world_energy = 1.5
            enemy_spawn_rate = 2.0
```

To extend a game with Ethereal Engine features, use the EtherealBridge component (available in future updates) which connects the Akashic system with the Ethereal Engine's reality-manipulation capabilities.

## Best Practices

1. **Always initialize the game framework first** before using any of its features
2. **Use the record_player_action method** for significant player activities to ensure they're tracked in the Akashic Records
3. **Test games in multiple dimensions** to ensure mechanics work properly across dimensional boundaries
4. **Implement dimension-specific visuals and mechanics** to take advantage of the dimensional system
5. **Use the framework's level management system** rather than handling levels manually
6. **Perform regular saves to multiple drives** to ensure data persistence across different storage systems
7. **Consider turn-specific features** to integrate with the 12-turn system
8. **Use the debugging features** during development to track system state

## Troubleshooting

1. **Game state not saving properly**
   - Check if the game framework is properly initialized
   - Ensure all necessary data is being included in the save

2. **Dimension effects not applying**
   - Verify the dimension controller is correctly connected
   - Check implementation of dimension-specific effects

3. **Cross-drive synchronization issues**
   - Verify drive paths are correct
   - Check drive connection status

4. **Turn effects not working**
   - Ensure turn manager is properly connected
   - Verify turn change signal connections

5. **Akashic Records not found**
