# Ethereal Akashic Engine

The Ethereal Akashic Engine expands the tunnel system with powerful Godot version migration, Akashic record connection, and fractal time dimensions. This system bridges all your projects across Godot versions while maintaining dimensional connections to your devices and preserving everything in the Akashic records.

## New Components

### 1. Godot Version Migration Tunnels

The `GodotVersionTunnel` creates dimensional tunnels between Godot versions (3.x to 5.0):

```gdscript
# Detect project version
var version = godot_version_tunnel.detect_project_version("path/to/project")

# Create migration tunnel
var migration = godot_version_tunnel.create_migration_tunnel(
    "path/to/godot3_project", 
    "path/to/godot4_target", 
    "4.0"
)

# Start migration
godot_version_tunnel.start_migration(migration)
```

#### Features:
- Automatic version detection across Godot 3.x, 4.0-4.5, and 5.0
- Code transformation for upgraded language features (annotations, typed arrays)
- Multi-hop migration tunnels for complex version paths
- Customizable transformation rules per version pair
- Dimensional anchoring for project stability during migration
- Word pattern integration for visualization
- Token system for stabilization using numeric patterns

### 2. Akashic Record Connection

The `AkashicRecordConnector` creates a persistent store for all ethereal data:

```gdscript
# Connect to Akashic database
akashic_record_connector.connect_to_akashic_database("local")

# Record code fragment
var record_id = akashic_record_connector.record_code_fragment(
    code, "gdscript", "path/to/file.gd", 
    {"tags": ["player", "movement"]}
)

# Query records
var results = akashic_record_connector.query_records(
    RecordType.CODE_FRAGMENT, 
    {"text": "func _process", "tag": "player"}
)
```

#### Features:
- Nine record types (code, project, scripts, words, dimensions, files, tokens, bridges)
- Persistent storage with indexing and querying
- Temporal memory imprints with automatic expiration
- Bridge connections to Claude and external databases
- Ethereal anchoring in information dimension
- Word pattern creation for memory imprints
- Token generation for dimensional stability

### 3. Fractal Time Dimension

The `FractalTimeDimension` creates fractal-based time scales for project processing:

```gdscript
# Shift time scale to micro level
fractal_time_dimension.shift_time_scale("micro", 1.0)

# Create a timeline branch
var branch_id = fractal_time_dimension.create_timeline_branch()

# Record event on timeline
fractal_time_dimension.record_timeline_event(
    {"type": "file_edit", "file": "player.gd", "changes": 5}
)

# Create temporal echo
fractal_time_dimension.create_temporal_echo(
    current_time, "main_branch", "feature_branch", 1.5
)

# Activate visualization
fractal_time_dimension.activate_visualization(my_3d_node)
```

#### Features:
- Five fractal time scales (micro, milli, normal, macro, cosmic)
- Timeline branching and merging for parallel development
- Temporal echoes between timeline shifts
- Timeline event recording and querying
- Real-time oscillation based on scale
- Interactive 3D visualization
- Dimensional tunnels between time scales
- Word pattern integration for temporal events

## Integration Example

```gdscript
# Upgrade Godot project with akashic record backup

# 1. Store project state in Akashic records
var project_path = "/path/to/godot3_project"
var project_record = akashic_record_connector.record_project_state(
    project_path, "3.x", {"description": "Pre-migration snapshot"}
)

# 2. Create fractal time branch for migration
var branch_id = fractal_time_dimension.create_timeline_branch(
    "migration_branch", "main"
)
fractal_time_dimension.switch_timeline_branch(branch_id)

# 3. Set up and run migration
var migration = godot_version_tunnel.create_migration_tunnel(
    project_path, 
    "/path/to/godot4_target", 
    "4.0"
)
godot_version_tunnel.start_migration(migration)

# 4. Create akashic record of migration
migration.connect("migration_completed", 
    func(success, stats):
        akashic_record_connector.record_dimensional_data(
            4, # Energy dimension
            {
                "migration": migration.id,
                "success": success,
                "stats": stats,
                "timestamp": fractal_time_dimension.current_time
            },
            "godot_migration"
        )
    )
```

## System Organization

The Ethereal Akashic Engine organizes across multiple dimensions:

| Dimension | Focus                | Color       | Systems                 |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 1         | Base Reality         | Red         | Base project files      |
| 2         | Time                 | Green       | Fractal time tunnels    |
| 3         | Space                | Blue        | Project structures      |
| 4         | Energy               | Yellow      | Migration transformers  |
| 5         | Information          | Magenta     | Akashic records         |
| 6         | Consciousness        | Cyan        | Temporal imprints       |
| 7         | Connection           | Orange      | Cross-device bridges    |
| 8         | Potential            | Purple      | Future version paths    |
| 9         | Integration          | Teal        | System unification      |

## Ethereal Workflow

1. **Connect Akashic Records**
   ```gdscript
   akashic_record_connector.connect_to_akashic_database("local")
   ```

2. **Establish Time Dimension**
   ```gdscript
   fractal_time_dimension.shift_time_scale("normal")
   ```

3. **Create Migration Tunnel**
   ```gdscript
   var migration = godot_version_tunnel.create_migration_tunnel(
       source_path, target_path, target_version)
   ```

4. **Run Migration Through Tunnel**
   ```gdscript
   godot_version_tunnel.start_migration(migration)
   ```

5. **Record Results in Akashic Records**
   ```gdscript
   akashic_record_connector.record_file_migration(
       source_file, target_file, source_version, target_version)
   ```

6. **Create Tunnels Between Projects**
   ```gdscript
   ethereal_tunnel_manager.establish_tunnel(
       "godot3_project", "godot4_project", 4)
   ```

7. **Transfer Data Through Tunnels**
   ```gdscript
   tunnel_controller.transfer_through_tunnel(
       tunnel_id, "Project migration complete")
   ```

## Akashic Bridge Integration

The system seamlessly integrates with Claude through the Akashic Bridge:

```gdscript
# Create Claude API bridge
var bridge_data = {
    "bridge_id": "claude_akashic_bridge",
    "type": "claude",
    "api_key": api_key
}

# Connect to Claude via bridge
akashic_record_connector.connect_to_akashic_database("bridge", bridge_data)

# Transfer project knowledge through the bridge
akashic_record_connector.record_word_pattern(
    "godot_migration_knowledge", 5, 30.0, 
    {"description": "Language feature transformations"}
)
```

The Claude bridge creates a direct connection to the Akashic records, allowing bidirectional knowledge transfer between your projects and Claude's understanding.

## Version Migration Path

The system supports the complete Godot evolution path:

```
Godot 3.x → 4.0 → 4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3 → 4.4 → 4.5 → 5.0
```

Each version pair has specialized transformation rules to handle language and API changes, with stability factors that reflect the complexity of each migration.

## Temporal Branching System

The fractal time dimension allows for branching timelines in your development:

```gdscript
# Create feature branch
var feature_branch = fractal_time_dimension.create_timeline_branch(
    "feature_branch", "main"
)

# Work in feature branch
fractal_time_dimension.switch_timeline_branch(feature_branch)

# Record work in current branch
fractal_time_dimension.record_timeline_event({
    "type": "feature_implementation",
    "feature": "player_abilities",
    "files_changed": ["player.gd", "abilities.gd"]
})

# Later, merge back to main
fractal_time_dimension.merge_timeline_branches(
    "feature_branch", "main"
)
```

This creates a dimensional record of parallel development paths that can be visualized, merged, and stored in the Akashic records.

## Getting Started

1. Add the Ethereal Akashic Engine components to your project
2. Connect to the Akashic records database
3. Configure the fractal time dimension with appropriate scales
4. Create anchors for your Godot projects with version detection
5. Establish tunnels between projects for migration
6. Use the timeline branching system to manage development paths
7. Record all operations in the Akashic records for future reference

This integrated system creates a complete framework for managing Godot projects across versions, dimensions, and time scales, with everything preserved in the eternal Akashic records.
