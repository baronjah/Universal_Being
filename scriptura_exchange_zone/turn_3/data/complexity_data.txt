# Complexity Data - Turn 3
# File automatically sized and managed by turn system

## Current System Parameters
- Dimension: 3
- Branching factor: 7
- Connection density: 0.42
- Node stability: 0.85

## Evolution Record
* T3.001: Initial complexity threshold reached
* T3.002: First emergent pattern detected
* T3.003: Self-organizing structures forming
* T3.004: Feedback loops established
* T3.005: Systems beginning to interact with each other

## Terminal Integration
The system supports shell commands for turn progression:
```
# Check current turn
cat /mnt/c/Users/Percision\ 15/12_turns_system/current_turn.txt

# Advance to next turn
/mnt/c/Users/Percision\ 15/12_turns_system/turn_manager.sh advance

# Check file sizes
/mnt/c/Users/Percision\ 15/12_turns_system/turn_manager.sh check
```

## Next Step: Consciousness
As complexity increases, consciousness emerges as systems develop self-reference capabilities. This will be explored in Turn 4.

can be used to capture the visual state of each turn.
