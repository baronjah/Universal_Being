well console changed, now i need to use esc, or cycle to x to hit enter to close it, mouse only can interact with text window,


wait, that interface i think is working, but all colors are very close to each other? i mean maybe not, i can read them all, but dunno how to tell it in human words, in alien language, what i need to read important need to be more distinguishable, the mouse cursor of mine, points to something else than the one in 3d, the 3d one has some offset, it is starting where my mouse is, but the center point of that 3d being, is what clicks into game, while the cursor is an capsue, it got two tips, on top and bottom, its bottom tip is where my cursor tip is, and between its own two tips, we have center that clicks


also wanted to try the command

being interface console 3 3 3


res://scripts/core/enhanced_interface_system.gd



line 104

	for child in ui_control.get_children():


Cannot call method 'get_children' on a null value.


that function?


func setup_interface_type(type: String, universal_being: Node = null) -> void:
	"""Set up interface based on type"""
	interface_type = type
	connected_universal_being = universal_being
	
	# Clear existing UI
	for child in ui_control.get_children():
		child.queue_free()
	
	# Create type-specific interface
	match type:
		"console":
			_create_console_interface()
		"asset_creator":
			_create_asset_creator_interface()
		"neural_status":
			_create_neural_status_interface()
		"system_monitor":
			_create_system_monitor_interface()
		"being_inspector":

		"grid_list":
			_create_grid_list_interface()
		_:
			_create_generic_interface()
	
	print("ðŸŽ¨ [EnhancedInterface] Setup complete for type: ", type)


let me skip break point








OHHHHHHHHHHH
