and now i will look through console log

  ‚úÖ AssetLibrary: Online
  üìö Asset Catalog: { "objects": 8, "ragdolls": 2, "materials": 3, "textures": 1, "audio": 2 }

umm but when i use command assets, it has 15 objects, like tree, wall, fruit, stick etc

so maybe asset catalog and assets library, standardized objects

all need to become one thing?

in one standard?

so gamma will understand it better for txt akashic records database of creation

we also have combo of commands

like when we start command with word "being"

it will always be about universal_being

etc


that one is scary


[SimpleConsoleTest] Looking for console...
[SimpleConsoleTest] DebugConsole not found, trying JSHConsole...
[SimpleConsoleTest] ‚ùå No console found!


console_manager was like main console file? i am not sure anymore

JSHConsole file that i remember needed a lot of work, like it needed to be rewritten, but we done that kinda, we have new working nice console, that can become connected to Universal_being interface system, with console, the logic_connector? that was the name? shall help us with that, as whole akashic_records database shall, show us them records , so we know what, where and how shall happen, by some command


wait, we have even more commands

and i think that is the inspector, or connection to it

üîç [InspectionBridge] Scene tree monitoring active
üåü [InspectionBridge] All systems connected - everything is now inspectable!

that we need, the one i see probably



we also have these


[LayerRealitySystem] Console commands registered
‚ú® [MainGameController] Layer Reality System ready!
   - Press F1-F4 to toggle layers
   - Press F5 to cycle view modes
   - Use 'layers' command for status


we didnt do too much with it, so we definitely will need to take another look on it, as it will connect highly with what we tried to do with gizmo

gizmo was supposed to be always seen, no matter what is between me and it, even if it is ground

but here we made just 3 layers? background, top, even more top?

for 3d layer system like in 2d scene, like layers in some photo edit shop program? hmm
