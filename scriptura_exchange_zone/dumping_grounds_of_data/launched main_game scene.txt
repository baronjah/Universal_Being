launched main_game scene

remember that this scene does not have gamma_ai scene two scripts loaded, so gamma stuff will be tested in another scene?

what i have noticed, the Message that was there, changed into new txt way, and i was able to move it aorund, clicked ground and it dissapeared, i might have moved mouse and micro clicked the x, somehow, will test again later

looks kinda different, it is like, it got two headers? on top? but the top top one, is for moving it around

Inspector still, cannot be moved around,	


being interface console
being create tree

i can inspect tree, but i cannot inspect interface now, somehow,


umm clicked on editor, debugger, errors
