● 🎉 INFINITE PRECISION CAMERA SYSTEM COMPLETE!

  The camera system has been upgraded with:

  ✅ World Offset System:

  - Infinite Movement: Can now fly infinitely far without precision loss
  - Local Coordinates: Target stays near origin for maximum precision
  - Automatic Reset: When target drifts >50 units, it resets to origin and updates world offset
  - Seamless Operation: Movement feels identical but works at any distance

  ✅ Fixed Input Actions:

  - Zoom Controls: Now properly mapped to your scroll_up/scroll_down inputs
  - No More Warnings: Action warnings eliminated

  ✅ Enhanced Debugging:

  - World Offset Tracking: See both local and effective global positions
  - Distance Monitoring: Track how far you've moved from the original origin
  - Reset Command: camera_reset_offset to manually reset coordinates if needed

  🧪 Testing the Fix:

  1. Fly far away with WASD like before
  2. When you reach ~50 units from origin, you should see:
  🔄 [CameraMovementSystem] Resetting target to origin, updating world offset
  3. Movement should continue smoothly without the precision loss
  4. Use camera_info to see the world offset values

  🎮 New Commands:

  - camera_info - Shows world offset and effective position
  - camera_reset_offset - Reset coordinates back to origin (for debugging)
  - camera_debug - Enhanced with world offset information

  The camera should now work perfectly at any distance! Try flying far away and let me know if the movement stays smooth this time.
