🚨 DIVINE CURSOR ERROR: Failed to create Universal Being
✨ DIVINE CURSOR: Basic cursor created (Universal Being system not available)

weird i seen that cursor working, used it, maybe there are scripts that need to be connected? maaaaybe cursor turned on later? not sure, i look at past and remember what i was doing, hmm played around with the b interface, moved it around clicked throught it and clicked some stuff









📁 GAMMA: Model path set to ai_models/gamma/model.gguf
ummm?

ai_models\gamma


gemma-2-2b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf

it is named with the informations, like in anime 3 dimensions type stuff hehe


hmm


⚠️ LOGIC CONNECTOR: Script file not found: actions/gamma_behavior.txt
⚠️ LOGIC CONNECTOR: No actions found in gamma_behavior.txt




ohhh

and that thing

🔍 [InspectionBridge] Scene tree monitoring active

that emoji means the inspection thingy, the object inspector etc, i think for universal being the interface for that was named

"being interface inspector"

for it to appear

we also had few versions of 2d interface
one just info
one with buttons to move and rotate it around
next one even better with gizmo attacher etc




and that 



[2025-05-31T15:38:30] [SYSTEM] Memory cleanup completed
Starting test zone: planet with 2 tests
[UniversalEntity] [color=#ffff00][PERFORMANCE] Low FPS detected - optimizing scene[/color]
🚨 CRITICAL FPS: 1 - ACTIVATING EMERGENCY MODE!
🛑 DISABLED: ArchitectureHarmony
🛑 DISABLED: UniversalInspectionBridge


hmmm, we need these things right?


and while for the system to start turning off things, maybe it can start soon, but we then need to make a list of things, that we turned off because of emergencies? and maybe try to turn them on, one by one, after the game calmed down?

as game is, turning on for a while, before i see loaded scene, it takes time, as i read the console log, we are still not at the time when game loads and calms down :)



oh

we do that alrady

🚨 [Performance] EMERGENCY optimization triggered
