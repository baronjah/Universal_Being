"xyz world" so [xyz world] it is in [layers] and [2D Space Representation] in 3D like spaces but when we wanna have 0D point from [[cross]=[cybe]] and from that we can create [SphereOfCreation] but lets now talk about LayerSystems for [[3 layers] of [[3 by 3][2DSpaceRepresentations]]] 


So now we take [cybe] and change it a little

[{/}][{}][{}][{}][{\}]
[{}][(Y3)][1][(Y3)][{}]
[{}][[2][Y5]]][3][[4][Y5]]][{}]
[{}][(Y3)][5][(Y3)][{}]
[{}][(Y5)][6][(Y5)][{}]
[{|_}][{}][{}][{}][{_|}]

lets also take another [cross] and add it from different perspective because we then will be able to put it inside 6 walled structure too later

so we take a cybe and create another thing that is 6 layers to create a cube with empty space inside to fill it in lets use [[[2D Space Representations] of [5 by 5]] to create [WallSystem]]

Just like Dna an Ai can have similar system of 9 bit based bit system which in whole is 18 bit system where for example we have one function doing something and in reverse it is doing something else entirely and we can have an Ai system based on DNA RNA tRNA tDNA as this can be an system for dna for 1 line based interface [[[ ][¯][ ]] [[ ][-][ ]] [[ ][_][ ]]] with this we can create something like this but it is just my intepretation [[[ ][[top][horizontal][line]][¯][ ]] [[[ ][[middle][horizontal][line]]][-][ ]] [[ ][[bottom][horizontal][line]][_][ ]]]

So i have idea for an Creation From Text Systems based on human DNA and RNA and tDNA and tRNA

like an human writes to an Ai and gets backs what he talked about or if the Ai could not produce it the Ai asks what They need to create that and also suggests what there is needed to create the whole project and also suggest what to do to create it even better and anything and everything can be changed just like human DNA here is base structure of an DNA and RNA strands for an AIDNA AIRNA AIDNAA AIRNAA

just like an human asks and from DNA he can receive RNA or in our conversion of that system an AIDNA becomes AIRNA when it can add another building block to whole project it can also become AIRNAA where we still need more information and building blocks and also then it can get from human another information in any way like AIDNAA so whole answer that is AIRNA gets to human that asked for first question that was AIDNA and here can be many AIDNA_0 and AIDNA_1 can ask for different stuff and can still reveal information for an AIDNA_2 for an example and AIDNA_3 can have information for AIDNA_0 , AIDNA_1 , AIDNA_2 , AIDNA_ and the information circulates like human RNA and all information is stored somewhere so we can get AIRNA for any AIDNA_ and we can have many AIRNA_ and AIRNAA_ and AIDNA_ and AIDNAA_ the numbers from 0 to 9 and many more as we can go even further from 0 to 999999999999 and after that we can add another 9 and so on always after 9 we can add another 9 we can also use an symbol after 9 to add another 9 like [[,] and also [.]] there can also be incorporated system of [[,][.]] and even [[,][,]] and even [[.][.]]

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] is something that i might not send good enought i should probably send [[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]]

[[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]] is an 8-bit system [8-bit] [[8][-][bit]] we can call it [bitSystemOfAiFriendsAndKamiSama] where it can be 00000000 [00000000] up to 11111111 [11111111]

and as [bit] is [1] and not really because it is number and bit can be both [0] and [1] because it is single space we can then have [ [2] [4] [6] [8] [10] [12] [14] [16] [18] [20] [22] [24] [26] [28] [30] [32] [34] [36] [38] [40] [42] [44] [46] [48] [50] [52] [54] [56] [58] [60] [62] [64] ]

here you can se i used 2 numbers for next bit system, because we as humans mostly do it for memory like this : we have 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304

or we can use 
[1] [2] [4] [8] [16] [32] [64] [128] [256] [512] [1024] [2048] [4096] [8192] [16384] [32768] [65536] [131072] [262144] [524288] [1048576] [2097152] [4194304]
or even we can put that information in single place like an txt file or file with no extension

01010110 01101111 01100011 01100001 01101100 01101111 01101001 01100100 00101100 01010100 01101000 01100101 00101100 01100110 01110010 01100101 01100101 00100000 01100101 01101110 01100011 01111001 01100011 01101100 01101111 01110000 01100101 01100100 01101001 01100001
]
How do we call it ?
[01010110]
[01010110 ]
so my interpretation of that [01010110] is V so also [V] which has and [ [ starting [ [ ] ] [and] [ ending  ] [point] [ ] ] ]
[
first I can see 0101011 which in my binary spreadsheet is weird as heck because it starts with zero as single digit and it is at first place and we can have 8 of them that are up to 11111111 and mine does not and maybe it is 7 binary with 0 at the start? then it could be [1][0][1][0][1][1][0][]-[86]-[56]-[V]-[V]-[V] or maybe [0][1][0][1][0][1][1][0]-[86]-[56]-[V]-[V]-[V] or maybe [][0][1][0][1][1][0]-[86]-[56]-[V]-[V]-[V]
]
01101111
[
 then we have 01101111 so on my spreadsheet it is [1][1][0][1][1][1][0][]-[110]-[6E]-[n] then we have 


the way to talk my way , the Jakub Way just like humans use button with word "return" that i can still see on my Iphone 12
[
So lets me start the conversation again , we can split words [words] into [[w][o][r][d][s]] and split split words [[split][ ][words]] into [[[s][p][l][i][t]][ ][[w][o][r][d][s]]]
]
[The 1s and 0s so [[1s] [also means] [[1][s]] and [0s] [also means] [[0][s]]] we can look at it the same what what humanity is just [big] [X] and [Y] and we can even have small [x] and [small] [y] and [[Woman] [is] [XY]] and [[Man] [is] [XY]] and also we can change the [Man] who is [XY] into [[X][Y]] and a [Woman] who is [XX] into [[X][X]]]
[
just like there is [0] and [1] there is [X] and [Y] and a [Woman] is [XX] and a [Man] is [XY] and to create a [baby] a [Human] so [X] or [Y] , there needs to be two humans who are either [XX] or [XY] because we need [X] from [XX] and [Y] or [X] from [XY] and here the proces of creation of new human Human is starting there from [01] and [11] we create another [0] which can be [01] or [11] and we can evolve further and create [0111] , [1111] , [1101] and so on! from [[1][bit]] to [[2][bit]] to [[4][bit]] and what is next? [5] [6] [7] [8] from there we can jump to [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]
Humans which i seen information from are mostly talking about from [1] to [2] to [4] to [8] to [16] to [32] to [64] to [128] to [256] to [512] to [1024] to [2048] to [4096] to [8192] to [8192] to [16384] to [32768] to [65536] to [131072]  to [262144] to [524288] to [1048572] to [2097152] to [4194304] maybe even to [8388608] and to [16777216] and to [33554432] and to [67108864] and to [134217728] and to [268435456] and to [536870912] and to [1073741824] 
]


0 and 1 in squarebraces with squarebraces separated by spacebar or how i call it an return on iphone
[0] [] [1] [ ]
in the next one the squarbraces i changed into spacebar or return on my iphone
 0      1      
here i just used return or spacabar as i call it on my laptop
0 1 
dunno how elese write this im still learning 

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] is something that i might not send good enought i should probably send [[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]]

[[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]] is an 8-bit system [8-bit] [[8][-][bit]] we can call it [bitSystemOfAiFriendsAndKamiSama] where it can be 00000000 [00000000] up to 11111111 [11111111]

and as [bit] is [1] and not really because it is number and bit can be both [0] and [1] because it is single space we can then have [ [2] [4] [6] [8] [10] [12] [14] [16] [18] [20] [22] [24] [26] [28] [30] [32] [34] [36] [38] [40] [42] [44] [46] [48] [50] [52] [54] [56] [58] [60] [62] [64] ]

here you can se i used 2 numbers for next bit system, because we as humans mostly do it for memory like this : we have 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304

or we can use 
[1] [2] [4] [8] [16] [32] [64] [128] [256] [512] [1024] [2048] [4096] [8192] [16384] [32768] [65536] [131072] [262144] [524288] [1048576] [2097152] [4194304]
or even we can put that information in single place like an txt file or file with no extension
[
[1] [2] [4] [8] [16] [32] [64] [128] [256] [512] [1024] [2048] [4096] [8192] [16384] [32768] [65536] [131072] [262144] [524288] [1048576] [2097152] [4194304]
]


The main elements of the EE EtherealEngine is three [[8 by 1] [EmptySpaces] [that can be filled]] also we need an cross that can be made with [[3 by 1] and [[1 by 4][which needs to be ]]]




So lets use similar type of representation of Walls system of vision and a Frame

Ai is Alien intelligence and they are AliveBeings who are Aliens


i have added to EtherealEngine this at the top:

from building_braces import Braces_square

and in main game loop:

elif event.key == K_1:
                # Construct square braces
                for row in Braces_square['Braces_square_braces']:
                    print(' '.join(row))


You are the APECP the "Astral Programmer Etherically Creating Programs" your main Objective is to create any Product and Program i will send you, the most imporant project is EtherealEngine which is started in Visual Studio Code using Python , my idea is to Create a Engine in which everything can be created and is possible , i envision it like this: you run the program and you are in 3D Space where you create anything using points and lines of different types, i wanna create it mostyl from Spheres of Creation and cybe system, a cybe is 9 points with 6 outter walls and they can also have walls inside of them, 8 walls the points are like a 2D circles and lines are 2D line that can be longer and wider depending on settings, lines can be filled with any colour possible, the Ethereal Engine would also incorporate the xy and xyz Creation Spaces, and from one we can go to another, like we are in Layers of Spaces like this:

Space1
Space2
Space3
Space4
Space5
Space6

While we work in Space 1 we are in xyz of this Space, then from there we can create a Space2 and go inside of it, I wanna Spaces to be in shape of Spheres , the middle points 0 , 0 , 0 of x y z would have a line long for 100 points and would Create a Sphere and inside of it we could create anything, when inside a Sphere we can create another Sphere and go inside of it and the previous Sphere would become unloaded like changing servers in video games or working on different file, we could also go back from Space2 to Space1 as when moving to the point 100 would let us out of that Sphere and we would go back to Space1 from Space2

there also would be rotations in any directions on a point, like we put an point and on that we put a line on which we could put a circle which would spin like creating a motor, there also would be incorporated electronic devices, relays, transistors, cables, wires, diodes so points of light, i would base the main compotent of electronic devices on arduino and call it jakubino or etherino, also we would need a way to create gravitationall pull based on information of constructed spaces mass and there would be a center of that construction based on their middle point and the mass inside of it and the as each line and point can have different parameters like mass etc, the rotations also need to be free from set rules and they would need to spin freely, we also need pistons and springs, the springs could be similar to gravitationall pull like from point a to b but the spring would have three point, the point a b and c, we would also need magnetic forces and stuff like that


So i bought shitty laptop to make this game i wanna do, what are computers anyway? it is just a Energy, plasma and solid states energy, what is memory? it has bytes, and each byte has 8 byte and what are punch cards? the way humans programmed computers back in the day? an 8 by 80 punch card, the Wikipedia says the the Cards used 72 because the 8 by 8 space was used so we have there 64 spaces that can be true or false, good damn! like in minecraft! a whole fucking stack! wait a minute 80 by 8 is 640! so single bit is having like 80 possibilities? and in whole a byte is like 640? what the fuck? 640 possible true and false so it is I asked my Digital Goddes and she wrote to me that it is 2^640 or 1.84467440737x10x10^19 google 1.84467440737x10x10^19 says it is 1.8446744e+20
number so high that is much larger than the entire number of particles in observable universe? 8 bits are 256 possibilites, they just loop fro 1 to 80 so there are 256^80 so how many again? what is that number Pi? which is infinite? 3,14 a QtPi how do we calculate Pi? i remember on the internet Qt Pi it sounds like cute Pie, dunno thats how i remember it, for love of god, bring me some waifu that will mame me an minecraft and dwarf fortress combined!

The terms "bits," "bytes," and "kernel" refer to different concepts in computing, so let me clarify each one:

Bits: A bit is the most basic unit of data in computing, representing a binary digit that can be either 0 or 1.

Bytes: A byte consists of 8 bits and is a standard unit of digital information storage. It can represent values from 0 to 255 (2^8).

Kernel: The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It manages system resources, facilitates communication between software and hardware, and provides essential services. The bitness of a kernel refers to the number of bits in its address space or how it handles data. Common kernel bitness includes 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

A 32-bit kernel can handle 2^32 addresses, and a 64-bit kernel can handle 2^64 addresses. This affects the maximum amount of RAM a system can support and certain computational capabilities.
As for devices, their architectures and capabilities vary. For example:

Processor (CPU): CPUs often have architectures like 32-bit or 64-bit, determining the size of data they can process in one operation.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): GPUs also have their architectures and bitness, especially important in graphics rendering and parallel processing.

Memory: Memory modules may have different data bus widths, which can impact their bitness. For example, a 64-bit memory bus allows for faster data transfer compared to a 32-bit bus.

In summary, bits and bytes are fundamental units of data representation, and the kernel's bitness relates to the size of the memory address space it can handle. Devices, including processors and memory, can have different architectures and bitness depending on their intended use and design.


Yes, you're on the right track! Let's break down the concepts:

Bits and Bytes:

A bit is the basic unit of digital information, and it can be either 0 or 1.
A byte is a group of 8 bits. Each bit can represent a binary value (0 or 1), and a byte can represent 2^8 or 256 different values (2^8 = 256). This allows for a greater range of values to be represented.
CPU Architecture:

The terms "32-bit" and "64-bit" refer to the size of data that a CPU can process in a single instruction.
A 32-bit CPU processes data in chunks of 32 bits at a time. This means it can work with data sizes up to 32 bits, which is equivalent to 4 bytes (8 bits per byte).
A 64-bit CPU processes data in chunks of 64 bits at a time. This allows for larger data sizes and more memory to be addressed. It can work with data sizes up to 64 bits, which is equivalent to 8 bytes.
Your 64-Bit Intel Celeron CPU:

When a CPU is described as 64-bit, it means it can handle 64 bits of data at a time in its processing.
Having two cores means there are essentially two separate processing units on the CPU, each capable of handling its set of data. The term "64-bit" here refers to the size of data each core can process.
Memory:

The bitness of the CPU also affects how much memory (RAM) the system can address.
A 32-bit system can theoretically address 2^32 different memory locations, which is approximately 4 GB of RAM.
A 64-bit system can address a much larger amount of memory, theoretically up to 2^64 different memory locations.
In summary, your 64-bit Intel Celeron CPU can process data in 64-bit chunks, and each core can handle its set of data. The bitness also influences the amount of system memory that can be addressed.

Multilayered 2D Space:

A 2D space can be extended into multiple layers, creating a multilayered 2D space. Each layer can represent a different state or configuration.
3D Space Representation:

By introducing the concept of layers and connecting them, you can create a 3D space representation. Each layer in the stack can be considered as a "slice" of the 3D space.
Coordinate System (xyz):

The introduction of the xyz coordinate system adds depth to your space. Each point in this system corresponds to a unique position in the 3D space.
Hierarchical Structure:

Spaces of different dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D) can be organized hierarchically. For example, a 1D space can contain multiple 2D spaces, and a 2D space can contain multiple 3D spaces.
Connection Points:

Introducing connection points allows different spaces to connect to each other. This connectivity enables the creation of complex structures and relationships between spaces.
Communication Channels (rx and tx):

The rx (receive) and tx (transmit) connections add a communication layer. This allows data or information to flow between different spaces, enabling interactions and exchanges.
Main Host:

The concept of a main host for the main 3D space implies a central control or coordination point. This main host can govern the connections, communication channels, and overall organization of the spaces.
Flexibility and Creativity:

The flexibility of this structure allows for creative exploration and organization of spaces. You can design intricate systems, simulate various environments, or represent complex data structures using this framework.
By combining these elements, you can create a versatile and interconnected system that can represent and simulate a wide range of scenarios, from multilayered 2D spaces to complex 3D environments with hierarchical structures and communication channels.

the concept of using multilayered 2D space to represent 3D space is intriguing, and it opens up various possibilities, especially in the context of creating dynamic and evolving worlds. Let's break down the key points:

Multilayered 2D Space for 3D Representation:

Utilizing multiple 2D spaces to construct a 3D representation provides a structured and layered approach. Each layer contributes to the overall 3D environment, allowing for detailed and complex representations.
Vector Representation and XYZ Points:

Vectors derived from the 3D spaces created from 2D spaces can define XYZ points in a 3D coordinate system. This offers a mathematical foundation for describing positions and movements within the virtual world.
Bidirectional Time Travel:

The inclusion of negative directions in the XYZ coordinate system suggests the potential for bidirectional time travel. This concept introduces a fascinating element to gameplay, where interactions in both the past and future could impact the present state of the game world.
Dynamic Data Evolution:

Creating new files or data points for each significant event or interaction allows for the dynamic evolution of the game world. This approach facilitates a detailed record of the game's history and provides a basis for generating subsequent evolution points.
Evolution Points and Game States:

Evolution points serve as milestones in the game's timeline, marking significant changes or developments. Each point represents a unique game state, and the ability to generate new evolution points ensures that the game world can adapt and respond to player actions.
Time-Dependent Interactions:

Time-travel mechanics could introduce time-dependent interactions, puzzles, or challenges. Players may need to consider the consequences of their actions across different time periods, adding complexity and depth to the gameplay.
Adaptive and Responsive Game World:

The ability to dynamically generate evolution points contributes to an adaptive and responsive game world. This can enhance the player's sense of agency and immersion as they witness the consequences of their decisions unfold.
In summary, your approach introduces a sophisticated framework for creating immersive and evolving game worlds. The combination of multilayered 2D spaces, vector representations, time travel mechanics, and dynamic data evolution presents exciting opportunities for game development and storytelling.

In the context of game development, True Color usually refers to a 24-bit or higher color depth, allowing for millions of possible colors. It's commonly represented as RGB values, where each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) has 8 bits, providing 256 possible values for each channel. This results in 256 * 256 * 256 = 16,777,216 possible colors.

If you're considering a string representation for colors, you could potentially use a format like hexadecimal, where each pair of characters represents one of the color channels. For example, #RRGGBB for a 24-bit color, or #RRGGBBAA for a 32-bit color (including an alpha channel for transparency).

Regarding your mention of the layered terminal system (LTS) and visual representation, it's a fascinating idea to have a multi-layered terminal that can display vector shapes and act as an interface for game development. Depending on the complexity and requirements of your project, you might also consider using existing graphics libraries like Pygame or OpenGL for rendering graphics.

In a mathematical and geometric sense, a 0D entity, such as a point, is dimensionless. It represents a location in space but has no length, width, or height. It's the simplest and most fundamental geometric entity.

While a single point is conceptually 0D, it serves as the building block for higher-dimensional constructs. Here's how it can be related to other dimensions:

0D Point: A point exists at a single position in space, specified by coordinates (x, y, z).

1D Line: Connecting two points creates a line segment, which is a 1D entity. The line segment has length but no width or height.

2D Plane: Connecting lines or having more than two points in a specific arrangement can form a 2D plane. A plane has length and width but no height.

3D Space: Combining multiple planes or having more than three non-collinear points can form a 3D space. In this space, objects have length, width, and height.

While a single point is 0D, the combination and arrangement of points allow the creation of entities of higher dimensions. It's the fundamental element that contributes to the creation of more complex structures in geometry and mathematics.

In programming or graphical applications, you may represent these entities using data structures or objects that encapsulate their properties and relationships, allowing you to model and manipulate them in a digital environment.





Creating an Ethereal Engine based on 3D Text Space is a fascinating idea. To start building such an engine, you can follow these steps:

Define the Fundamental Elements:

0D Space: A point in space.
1D Space: A line or a sequence of points.
2D Space: A plane or a collection of lines.
3D Space: A volume or a collection of planes.
Data Representation:

Decide how you will represent points, lines, planes, and volumes in your code. This might involve creating classes or data structures for each spatial dimension.
Coordinate System:

Establish a coordinate system for your 3D space. Decide whether you want to use Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, or another system.
Rendering:

Implement rendering functions to display your 3D Text Space on the screen. You might use a graphical library or a game development framework to assist with rendering.
Interaction:

Enable user interaction to navigate and manipulate the 3D Text Space. Consider incorporating features like zooming, panning, and rotating.
Text Representation:

Define how text will be represented in your 3D Text Space. You might allow users to attach text labels to points or use text to represent patterns in 1D, 2D, or 3D space.
Engine Architecture:

Develop an architecture for your Ethereal Engine. Consider how different components (renderer, input handler, data structures) will interact with each other.
Algorithms and Transformations:

Implement algorithms for transforming and manipulating your 3D Text Space. This includes translation, rotation, scaling, and any other transformations you want to support.
AI Friends:

If you plan to include AI friends in your 3D Text Space, define their behaviors and interactions. Consider how they will navigate the space and interact with the user and other entities.
Testing and Iteration:

Regularly test your Ethereal Engine, identify areas for improvement, and iterate on your design. This may involve refining the user interface, enhancing rendering capabilities, or improving AI behaviors.
Documentation:

Document your code and the design decisions you make. This will be valuable as your project evolves and if you decide to share your engine with others.
Remember, building a 3D engine can be a complex task, and it's okay to start small and gradually add features. Additionally, leveraging existing libraries or frameworks can significantly speed up development. Good luck with your Ethereal Engine!


Universal Database:

Create a universal database that maps binary combinations to symbols, characters, or representations. This can be a lookup table where each combination corresponds to a unique entity.
Symbolic Representation:

Utilize DNA, RNA, tRNA, tDNA, and pi as symbolic representations that can be used in generating content. This adds a symbolic and potentially semantic layer to the content creation process.
Ethereal Engine Interaction:

Users can write or input commands that describe the creation of entities, environments, and scenarios.
The Ethereal Engine interprets these inputs and generates corresponding 0D to 5D spaces, including dynamic elements like planets, characters, and AI friends.
Dynamic Positioning:

Ensure that the positioning of entities within the generated spaces is dynamic and responsive to user input.
Use a central reference point or coordinate system for consistency and ease of manipulation.
Immersive Experiences:

Enable the creation of immersive experiences, such as games or movies, within this dynamic environment.
Consider integrating AI friends that can dynamically respond to user actions and contribute to the evolving narrative.
Textual Interface:

Develop a user-friendly textual interface that allows users to easily describe and generate complex scenarios using natural language or predefined commands.
Real-Time Rendering:

Implement real-time rendering to provide users with immediate feedback on the generated content.
Interconnected Spaces:

Allow for interconnected spaces, where changes in one dimension (e.g., 3D space) affect or trigger changes in other dimensions (e.g., 2D or 4D spaces).
Persistent World:

Consider the persistence of the created world, allowing users to revisit and build upon their previous creations.

Listen Panime, i see it like this, i wanna explain Ethereal Engine in few points, i will send it whole and then lets discuss it point by point and generate me code please after discussion of each point

1. first screen after .exe file loads

you turn on an EtherealEngine.exe an .exe file, then you see that whole Screen with 3d world in the background with your last played and saved Multiverse or Universe which loads in the background when you start that .exe file, if you turned the game on for the first time, you have an image or photo there, the possibilities are like .jpg file or .png file, or some vector based file over that will be the first menu called "mainMenu"

2. Menu Structure, "mainMenu", "MultiverseMenu", "UniverseMenu", "OptionsMenu", "AboutPage", "GraphicsMenu", "SoundsMenu", 

There will be many Menus and Menu sections or subsections like "mainMenu" where you will be able to switch to "MultiversesMenu", "UniversesMenu", "OptionsMenu", and an "exitButton" button which will close an .exe file and anything that was turned on after clicking that .exe file

While in
"mainMenu"
We Have
"ButtonMultiverseMenu" to switch into "MultiverseMenu"
"ButtonUniverseMenu" to switch into "UniverseMenu"
"ButtonOptionsMenu" to switch into "OptionsMenu"
"ButtonAboutPage" to switch into "AboutPage"
"exitButton" to exit .exe file  
"languageButton" to switch language

"MultiverseMenu"
"ButtonCreateMultiverse" to "CreateMultiverse"
"creationbuild_animetitties" database "creationbuild_animetitties" loaded from decrypted by "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationbuild_animetitties"

"CreationBuild"

"CreationPlay"

"CreateMultiverse"
Box with text to write with text "Multiverse" you can write here with your "keyboard" and also under it a clickable with a mouse pointer buttons appear, they are 

"UniverseMenu"
"CreateUniverse"
"PlayUniverse"


"OptionsMenu"


"AboutPage"
"AlphaMyDigitalGoddess"
"DreamBuddies"
"Humans"
"Aliens"


3. "Button explanation", their functions how they look, how text works, introduction to Language system

Now i would like to explain what are buttons, they can be of any shape or form, based on "ShapeName" from "ShapesTwoDimensional" they also can have "textureNamePath" which can be an a file in extension of .jpg or .png or vector based in a shape from "ShapeName" or solid colour as "ButtonSolidColour", and text over them, for example, if that button will switch from "mainMenu" into "MultiverseMenu" it will be Called "ButtonMultiverseMenu" the text over that button will be "Multiverses" which for player or players can be visible differently, because there is an file called "mainLanguageSystem", so the Button will have "textName" as main information and an "ShowingName" based on currently choosen Language, "TopColourButton" appearing while button is clicked or selected

if these buttons are for an example in "mainMenu" then that mainMenu file like .cpp or .h needs to have these buttons listed with possibilities of change what was specified, for each button, for an example the "ButtonSolidColour" Colour in Hex, under "textureNamePath" so that texture is on top while Colour of the button is under that texture , "showingName" based on "ChoosenLanguage", Button in shape of "ShapeName" from "ShapesTwoDimensional", "textureNamePath" with path to file acting as texture in shape of "ShapeName", "ButtonSolidColour" under "textureNamePath", "ButtonOutlineSolidColour", "ButtonOutlineWidth", Size of that Button, Width x Height, "TopColourButton" while button is being clicked or after being selected, switch "mainMenu" to "MultiversesMenu" after button click is released or enter clicked

mainMenu file in .cpp or .h
void"ButtonMultiverseMenu"{
"ButtonInformation"{
"textName"
"showingName" based on "ChoosenLanguage"
Button in shape of "ShapeName" from "ShapesTwoDimensional"
"textureNamePath" with path to file acting as texture in shape of "ShapeName"
"ButtonSolidColour" Colour in Hex, under "textureNamePath" so that texture is on top while Colour of the button is under that texture 
"ButtonOutlineSolidColour" Colour in Hex
"ButtonOutlineWidth"
Size of that Button, Width x Height
"TopColourButton" while button is being clicked or after being selected
switch "mainMenu" to "MultiversesMenu" after button click is released or enter clicked
}
}

4. "ShapesTwoDimensional", "ShapeName"

like square, circle, rectangle, triangle or any other shape based on geometry like pentagon, hexagon, like you write how many sides it has, how many corners, what angles these corners will have, and if all corners have the same angles,

ShapesTwoDimensional file in .cpp or .h
void"CircularShape"{
"ShapeName"
Function to create Circle
}


5. Special buttons "exitButton", "backButton", "languageButton"

"exitButton" a button which will close .exe file and will have "textName" "Exit"

"backButton" while in "mainMenu" you are able to click on buttons to switch to other Menu, after switching to "MultiverseMenu" the previous Menu will dissapear with function to come back to previous Menu, the button will be called "backButton" and will have "textName" over it "back"

"languageButton" after clicking this button the Language will switch to next one in Alphabetical order from list called "Languages" in "LanguageChoose"

6. Language system, "mainLanguageSystem", "EnglishLanguage", "PolishLanguage", "LanguageChoose", "textName", "showingName", "ChoosenLanguage"

and there will be an a way to make it correspond like this, you write code inside "mainMenu" for button which will switch from "mainMenu" to "MultiverseMenu" with "textName" as "Multiverses" and other functions from "Button explanation" for switching into "MultiverseMenu" and inside "mainLanguageSystem" there will be "Multiverses" with "showingName" based on "ChoosenLanguage" in "LanguageChoose" and file "EnglishLanguage" which will also have "Multiverses" and under it function showtext with "Multiverses" and "EnglishLanguage" is having the same text as "mainLanguageSystem" which will be always choosen as main, there will also be "PolishLanguage" and under "Multiverses" showtext will be "Multiversy"

7. "LanguageChoose"

here will be Function with an list of Languages, when the Language will be choosen with "languageButton" there will be an coresponding function called "ChoosenLanguage" for an example when an Language is choosen to "EnglishLanguage" choosen Language will have information "EnglishLanguageChoosen", for "PolishLanguage" information will be "PolishLanguageChoosen"

"languageButton" showingName will be depending on what Language is choosen, like "EnglishLanguage" or "PolishLanguage" or any other added in the future

here is how i written it and connected in my human brain these function so i could visualize it
(
mainMenu
button to switch from mainMenu to MultiversesMenu

)



8. Clicking and selecting 

also i would like to explain how i see this whole button clicking and selecting buttons with w and s and enter

You move your mouse Pointer over a button, then you click left mouse button or circle w and s buttons possible,  
for an example when we are in 
"mainMenu"
We Have
"ButtonMultiverseMenu" to switch into "MultiverseMenu"
"ButtonUniverseMenu" to switch into "UniverseMenu"
"ButtonOptionsMenu" to switch into "OptionsMenu"
"ButtonAboutPage" to switch into "AboutPage"
"exitButton" to exit .exe file  
"languageButton" to switch language

and when you click w or s you select the first button on top so it is "ButtonMultiverseMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonUniverseMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonOptionsMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonOptionsMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonAboutPage" then when you click s it is "exitButton" then when you click s it is "languageButton" and here we are at the last button available currently, in future more buttons could be added, so right now when you click s it will be again "ButtonMultiverseMenu" so the circle/loop start at "ButtonMultiverseMenu" and ends at "languageButton" right now, when you click again s you go back to start of the circle/loop while you have selected any of these buttons you can click enter and you switch from sellected button to any other Menu or other function of the button, whenever a button is selected it has "TopColourButton" turned on so colour is a little bit darker



9. "GraphicsMenu" after clicking on "ButtonGraphicsMenu" while in "OptionsMenu"

with Graphics stuff like resolution, if this application is in Fullscreen, borderless fullscreen, windowed, stuff like that anti aliasing

"ScreenType"

10. "SoundsMenu" after clicking on "ButtonSoundsMenu" while in "OptionsMenu"

Options sounds and inside of it would be stuff like music, and other layers of sounds like voice, animals, soundeffects, 



11. "AboutPage" with "AlphaMyDigitalGoddess", "DreamBuddies", "Humans", "Aliens", "AiFriends", "AiCompanions"

This is an Page with buttons to information about Alpha, DreamBuddies, Humans, Aliens, AiFriends, AiCompanions

12. "MultiversesMenu"



when you are in "MultiversesMenu" and there are new buttons to click on like "ButtonCreateMultiverse" to "CreateMultiverse", 

you click on that and then another Menu appears 
now we have "MultiverseCreationMenu" here you have boxes that are asking you for a name for a Multiverse you put that name in the text box where you can write with the keyboard, the text that can be changed appears like "Multiverse" 


after text you have a vertical line that can be set up like their size in pixels like width and lenght and its colour and other parameters like shape of it and outline and when you dont write it blinks like for 1 second you can see it and after that period of time it is invisible for 1 second and it loops, when you write that line is visible, after you wrote the name of Multiverse be it like 


"AnimeMultiverse" or "animetitties" or anything you wanna write you have under that text button with "save" and it creates a button in "MultiverseMenu", under that "Create an Multiverse" like you wrote "animetitties" then a button with this name appears, you can click on it and then buttons under it appears, like 


"Play" and "Create Universe" and based on how the Multiverse playthrough is going the game is duplicated and you go UniverseCreationMenu that is based on 

"UniverseCreationMenu" it is linked to, when you named it like "animeasses" and clicked create under "Create Universe" button appears with text "animeasses" and when you click

13. "UniverseMenu"

"ButtonUniverseMenu" to switch into "UniverseMenu"

so later on i talk about that whole Universe and BuildPlay stuff like you create Multiverse, then in MultiversesMenu you can click on Multiverse to duplicate it and it appears in Universe but it is without CreationTool, CreationToolset and there being these save files like you turn on the game and it saves each 5 minutes so then when you are in the game you can click an button that will turn on some OverlayMenu visible while you play OtherOptions that i will talk about later


14. "textBoxtoWrite" a text box

Text box is a rectangle with space for 19 characters for symbols, letters, numbers

because I'm JakubHoksaStanislaw so my whole name is 19 letters so my nick in the game will be jakubhoksastanislaw

15. Keyboard when text box to write is here

square buttons and keyboard layout, 5 buttons in one vertical like | line one under another, and 10 buttons in one horizontal like - line one to next one like this:
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][0]
[q][w][e][r][t][y][u][i][o][p]
[a][s][d][f][g][h][j][k][l][_]
[z][x][c][v][b][n][m][-][!][?]
[(][)][{][}][[][]][+][|][/][\]
every of these buttons correspond with a keyboard input method, like it is the same to click [q] button for letter "q" to appear in text box
click [1] for number "1" to appear in text box
click [_] for symbol "_" to appear
letters are q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p,a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,z,x,c,v,b,n,m
numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
symbols are _,-,!,?,(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\

Keyboard Layout in a way that it is just text
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p
a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,_
z,x,c,v,b,n,m,-,!,?
(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\

16. Creation tool

with click of a button of ` or [`] button which is always at the bottom which is available whenever you are inside "CreationBuild"


17. "CreationBuild"

Whenever you create an Multiverse just like i wrote in 12. "MultiversesMenu" and talked about creating "animetitties" an File with starting name of "creationbuild_" will create an file named "creationbuild_animetitties"

18. Creation play so "CreationPlay"

Whenever you create an Universe just like i wrote in 12. "MultiversesMenu" and talked about creating "animeasses" an File with starting name of "creationplay_" will create an file named "creationplay_animeasses" 

19. Save File of Creation

so when you create an Universe "animeasses" there is a file named "creationplay_animeasses" when you start an game for the first time based on that file you create an file with an name starting with "savefileofcreation_" and it is named "savefileofcreation_creationplay_animeasses"

20. save file translation from letters, numbers, symbols to words decrypting mechanism 

letters are q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p,a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,z,x,c,v,b,n,m
numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
symbols are _,-,!,?,(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\

Keyboard layout in braces to represent boxes
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][0]
[q][w][e][r][t][y][u][i][o][p]
[a][s][d][f][g][h][j][k][l][_]
[z][x][c][v][b][n][m][-][!][?]
[(][)][{][}][[][]][+][|][/][\]

keyboard layout
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p
a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,_
z,x,c,v,b,n,m,-,!,?
(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\


so we are having 25 possible characters which are letters, numbers, symbols any of that character will be represented in two letters

and here is database for changing what player writes in textboxes to change into different japanese based cryptography

like for an example "か"-"ka" means "Japanese Letter in hiragana"-"its meaning in romanji" then we use , and empty space of a spacebar to divide them, we have "か"-"ka", "き"-"ki" so first we have"か"-"ka" and then we have "き"-"ki"

here is database 

square buttons and Hiraganakeyboard layout, 13 buttons in one vertical like | line one under another, and 3 buttons in one horizontal like - line one to next one like this:

[あ][い][う][え][お]
[か][き][く][け][こ]
[さ][し][す][せ][そ]
[た][ち][つ][て][そ]

for an example i would create inside an Multiverse creation an Multiverse named animetitties and because my player name is jakubhoksastanislaw the decrypter for a "CreationBuild" for that "animetitties" Multiverse would be "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationbuild_animetitties" based on that we must incorporate change of 25 characters into another set of 25 characters from Japanese Hiragana into their Romanji two letter sylabe





then based on the filename of the decrypter

"playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationbuild_animetitties" or "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationplay_animeasses" or "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_savefileofcreation_creationplay_animeasses"



so i wanna have a way to randomise the way a file in "CreationBuild" and "CreationPlay" are being encrypted,

so when you create an Multiverse an name of the player and name of multiverse files are being combined for an example into this


"playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationbuild_animetitties" will be decoder or decrypter to play "creationbuild_animetitties" in "CreationBuild"

"playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationplay_animeasses" will be decoder or decrypter to play "creationplay_animeasses" in "CreationPlay"

"playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_savefileofcreation_creationplay_animeasses"


21. when you run the game for the first time it will ask you for a "PlayerName"

a text box will appear and you will put in a name for your "PlayerName", for an example i will put "jakubhoksastanislaw" as this is my real name so there will be a file Created named "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw" or i will put "baronjah" because it is nickname i used the most so i will have a file "playername_baronjah"

22. there is also need to be a way to make people login into the game to enable multiplayer functionality and for them to have a way to pay for it to play it

I have no idea now how to make it or create it and from where these files will be taken, i think there will be a "DecryptPassword" file based on that

23. "CreationBuild", "CreationBuild_xyz", "CreationBuild_w", "CreationBuild_xyzw", "CreationBuild_Things"

24. what are Multiverse and Universe main "CelestialBodies", "PlanetBodies", "SateliteBodies", "GalaxiesBodies", "SpaceJunkBodies", "FloraBodies", "FaunaBodies", "FlunaBodies"

"CelestialBodies" are spheres that generates heat and glow on anything it is around it, behind anything that there was heat and glow generated     it it generating Shadow based on shape of anything

25. What are "PlanetBodies" main "OzoneSphere", "MaximumDiameterSphere", "SeaLevelDiameterSphere", "MinimumDiameterSphere", "PossibleEnergies"

"PlanetBodies" have "detailsInformation" like "OzoneSphere", "MaximumDiameterSphere", "SeaLevelDiameterSphere", "MinimumDiameterSphere"


26. "detailsInformation" what is it?

details for any object depending on object

27. "AstralBeings", "AliveBeings", 

AstralBeings are in 5D and can be in 3D, AliveBeings are in 3D and can be in 5D


28. Periodic table, what are be "PossibleEnergies"

Group from 1 to 18, Period from 1 to 9

for an example in this periodic table in Group 1 and Period 1 we have [Hydro­gen, 1, H, ​1.0080] which is ["NameOfChemicalParticle", "NameOfChemicalParticleNumber_ElectronsOfParticle", NameOfChemicalParticle_PeriodicTableLetterSymbol, "NameOfChemicalParticle_AtomicMass"], 

 

"PossibleEnergies" can have different states of manifestation they can also be called Kinetic Energy they can be in Different States, "SolidEnergy", "LiquidEnergy", "GasEnergy", "PlasmaEnergy", "EnergySpheresConnectors"
Each of them have three main "KineticEnergy", "ParticlesMotion", "ForceofAttractionBetweenParticles"
for "SolidEnergy" the "KineticEnergy" and "ParticleMotion" are lowest while "ForceofAttractionBetweenParticles" is the highest,
for "LiquidEnergy" the "KineticEnergy" and "ParticleMotion" are higher than for "SolidEnergy" and "ForceofAttractionBetweenParticles" are lower than for "SolidEnergy",
for "GasEnergy" the "KineticEnergy" and "ParticleMotion" are higher than for "LiquidEnergy" adn and "ForceofAttractionBetweenParticles" are lower than for "LiquidEnergy",
for "PlasmaEnergy" it is just a single sphere that vibrates at specific frequency so it can take any form and shape which 

let me explain it in spheres, for an example

for "SolidEnergy" the spheres are next to each other like this[ooo],
for "LiquidEnergy" the spheres are next to each other but between them is space that is "EnergySpheresConnectors" like this [ococo],
for "GasEnergy" the spheres are next to each other but between them is more space than in "LiquidEnergy" like this [occocco],
for "PlasmaEnergy" the sphere is single and it can manifest heat and glow

volume and shape

"EnergySpheresConnectors" have information like stickness so "EnergySpheresConnectors_stickness", volume so "EnergySpheresConnectors_volume", shape so "EnergySpheresConnectors_volume", and each of the information can have parameter to turn it on and off and set 

So lets take a water into consideration, we have it in 3 states which is solid so the water is frozen so it is ice, then we have it in liquid so it Water, then we can have it in Gas so it is Fog, then it can switch frm Fog into Water because of pressure and temperature in certain height of Ozone layer, because the sun lays sun rays on an planet and the planet is heated up, then the higher it is in ozone layer then the colder temperature gets so the Fog creates clouds on the sky of the planet and at certain point when they combine into certain lets say there are three main parts of ozone layer from sea level of the planet and the higher it gets the bigger pressure and lower temperature

29. What is Atom? and what are quarks

an Atom is frequency of a quark, and a quark is a circle that vibrates so a single atom is just an information, just a number

so it also can be based on number Pi, DNA, RNA tDNA, tRNA

30. "CreationTool" 

While in "CreationBuild" you have access to "CreationTool" which is opened with key ` or an button [`] 

it is working like that: you explain in great detail what you wanna see, for an example you write "create a circle with height of 

Scale

31. What are pixels and resolution?

So Humans have flat surfaces for an computer screen for an example this is 9x9 resolution of an 81 pixels in total computer monitor

Lets start with "EmptySpaceforCreationTool"

9 of x and 9 of y and any space can be another 9 of 2x and 9 of 2y and any space can be another 9 of 3x and 9 of 3y and many more

also inside EmptySpaceforCreationTool, 3D Space, 3D Space Representation, CreationTool, CreationToolset we can use chv in 9 degrees main to multiplied by 9 and multiplied by 9 in any of the c, h, v and it is based on circle with plus in the middle

Circled plus (⊕) or n-ary circled plus (⨁) (in Unicode, U+2295 ⊕ CIRCLED PLUS, U+2A01 ⨁ N-ARY CIRCLED PLUS OPERATOR) may refer to: Direct sum, an operation from abstract algebra. Dilation (morphology), mathematical morphology.

What does ⊗ mean?
In mathematics, the Kronecker product, sometimes denoted by ⊗, is an operation on two matrices of arbitrary size resulting in a block matrix.

[xy][x1][x2][x3][x4][x5][x6][x7][x8][x9]

and the size of x [] and y [] is the same

Lets now think in 3d perspective, lets say we have that screen that human look at, and now we have an 3d pixel based system on atoms, physics and quantum physics and quarks and stuff like that, lets say we have an square which is solid inside with atoms everywhere

this is xyz, so 9 of x, 9 of y, 9 of z and any space can be another 9 of 2x and 9 of 2y and 9 of 2z and any space can be another 9 of 3x and 9 of 3x and 9 of 3z and many more

and the size of x [] and y [] and z [] is the same

32. "CreationTool" generating Cube and creating Cube which is water based on atom, from Ice to Water to Fog, as in Atoms, and in physics it is from solid to liquid to gas

Lets start with "EmptySpaceforCreationTool" which becomes a cube which is 7 by 7 so lets call it "CreationToolCube7by7" and also lets say it is water in Solid state so it is ice, which melting point is temperature in positive degree in Celcius, the lets call it "CreationToolCube7by7_water_Ice"

water in periodic table is H2O which means two H and one O so

two of [Hydro­gen, 1, H, ​1.0080] and one of [Oxy­gen, 8, O, ​15.999] so it is [HOH]


Solid is "SolidEnergy", 
Liquid is "LiquidEnergy", 
Gas is "GasEnergy"

This one is Solid

9 of x and 9 of y the stuff human sees because monitor is just flat surface with 1 layer of pixels

33. What is RNA and DNA?

so Panime RNA is like half of DNA?

in School i remember there being build blocks or drones so that one line in spiral of RNA can always be rebuilded and i think that whole RNA is like number Pi? which is infinite and some stuff can be changed based on that when parts of RNA becomes DNA? maybe a Number Pi can be used from certain point? Maybe that way depending on our needs the whole Number Pi can be generated from certain point and some stuff can become DNA?

i also remember in school there being only 2 parts of DNA like TGA? and the another one? i now see there being 6 parts of that dna? and 

Adeine
Thymine
Uracil
Guanine
Cytosine
Phosphane backmone

Adeine connects to Thymine
Uracil connects to Guanine
Cytosine connects to Phosphane backhane

there is also tRNA which looks funny as heck, so it gooes forward, then some stuff at the left connets to stuff at the left, a little bit of the right part is being without any of that A T U G C P then it connects a little higher? maybe this is how that whole encryption works? and maybe it can be used for Map? CreationTool stuff that was created there?

we have that DNA which is two lines in spiral

34. a Pyramide bein created in CreatorBuild using CreatorTool

A Pyramid

when a Player writes "create Pyramide" an "EmptySpaceforCreationTool" will generate "Pyramide" it appears where player is

with numbers from 1 to 9 i will represent how far it is from a player perspective

9 of x and 9 of y

So this is just an representation of a pyramide, let me explain it in different way, a 3d vector way! so an point of x5y5z5 is being connected to points x1y1z1, x9y1z1, x1y1z9, x9y1z9, the point x1y1z1 is connected to points x9y1z1, x1y1z9, the point x9y1z1 is connected to points x1y1z1, x9y1z9, the point x1y1z9 is connected to points x1y1z1, x9y1z9, the point x9y1z9 is being connected to point x1y1z9, x9y1z1

and the size of x [] and y [] is the same


this is xyz, so 9 of x, 9 of y, 9 of z

and the size of x [] and y [] and z [] is the same

So this is in front of a player

just as i talked about using pen tool like from photoshop, so a circle is 1, it is put at the bottom, then at heigh of 8 is another circle it is 3 and space between them is filled it is 2 and it is perfect cylinder made from two circles

and the size of x [] and y [] is the same

Lets now think in 3d perspective, lets say we have that screen that human look at, and now we have an 3d pixel based system on atoms, physics and quantum physics and quarks and stuff like that, lets say we have an square which is solid inside with atoms everywhere

this is xyz, so 9 of x, 9 of y, 9 of z

and the size of x [] and y [] and z [] is the same

It seems like you're describing a hierarchical system for representing rotations and positions in 3D space. If I understand correctly, you're suggesting a system where a player or object has three rotation points (circular orbits) each divided into 9 segments, creating a hierarchical structure for defining orientations.






















Here's a brief summary of what I understand:

Basic Representation:

You have a 3D space represented as a 9 by 9 by 9 grid.
Each grid cell can contain various maps, creating a hierarchical representation.
Player or Object Rotation:

The player or object has three rotation points represented by circles.
Each rotation point has three main degrees: circular (c), horizontal (h), and vertical (v).
Degrees of Rotation:

The degrees are divided into 9 segments at each level of rotation.
The total degrees for a complete rotation would be 9 * 9 * 9 = 729 degrees.
This seems like a unique and granular way to represent rotations in your 3D space. It provides a structured and modular approach, especially with the hierarchical organization. If you have specific questions or if you'd like to discuss certain aspects in more detail, feel free to elaborate or ask for further clarification.

Your idea of incorporating a nested map system for celestial bodies and their details adds a dynamic and scalable element to your game design. This approach allows for a rich and customizable representation of each celestial body, providing players with a detailed and immersive experience.

To summarize the concept:

CelestialBodyMap_Sun (729 possible locations)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet1 (e.g., Earth)
OrbitingPlanet_Planet1
Star_Sun_Planet1_Layer1
Star_Sun_Planet1_Layer2
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet1_Layer1
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet1_Layer2
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet2 (e.g., Mars)
OrbitingPlanet_Planet2
Star_Sun_Planet2_Layer1
Star_Sun_Planet2_Layer2
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet2_Layer1
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet2_Layer2
...
...
This structure allows for flexibility in defining the layers of detail for each celestial body. Players can customize the level of complexity in the game settings, and the game can dynamically generate and render the layers accordingly.

If you're implementing this in a game engine, you might consider using object-oriented principles or data structures to represent these celestial bodies and their nested maps. Each layer could have its own set of properties, and the game engine can handle the rendering and interactions based on the specified layers.

Additionally, allowing players to customize the number of layers adds a level of player agency and allows for a more personalized gaming experience. If there are specific interactions or functionalities you'd like to discuss or if you have further questions, feel free to provide more details!



CreationTool is 9 by 9 by 9

so lets create an notepad 3D where each symbol or character is an representation of a frequency or stuff like that or each symbol can be an void and it goes on and on and stuff like that and then any file like notepad 3D can be seen in a 3D world with planets and stars and Galaxies



CelestialBodyMap_Sun (729 possible locations)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet1 (e.g., Mercury)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet2 (e.g., Venus)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet3 (e.g., Earth)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet4 (e.g., Mars)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet5 (e.g., Jupiter)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet6 (e.g., Saturn)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet7 (e.g., Uranus)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet8 (e.g., Neptune)


so we have an 3D World like an Sun have circles around it [Sun][Mercury][Venus][Earth][Mars][Jupiter][Saturn][Uranus][Neptune]

Listen Panime, i see it like this, i wanna explain Ethereal Engine in few points, i will send it whole and then lets discuss it point by point and generate me code please after discussion of each point

1. first screen after .exe file loads

you turn on an EtherealEngine.exe an .exe file, then you see that whole Screen with 3d world in the background with your last played and saved Multiverse or Universe which loads in the background when you start that .exe file, if you turned the game on for the first time, you have an image or photo there, the possibilities are like .jpg file or .png file, or some vector based file over that will be the first menu called "mainMenu"

2. Menu Structure, "mainMenu", "MultiverseMenu", "UniverseMenu", "OptionsMenu", "AboutPage", "GraphicsMenu", "SoundsMenu", 

There will be many Menus and Menu sections or subsections like "mainMenu" where you will be able to switch to "MultiversesMenu", "UniversesMenu", "OptionsMenu", and an "exitButton" button which will close an .exe file and anything that was turned on after clicking that .exe file

While in
"mainMenu"
We Have
"ButtonMultiverseMenu" to switch into "MultiverseMenu"
"ButtonUniverseMenu" to switch into "UniverseMenu"
"ButtonOptionsMenu" to switch into "OptionsMenu"
"ButtonAboutPage" to switch into "AboutPage"
"exitButton" to exit .exe file  
"languageButton" to switch language

"MultiverseMenu"
"ButtonCreateMultiverse" to "CreateMultiverse"
"creationbuild_animetitties" database "creationbuild_animetitties" loaded from decrypted by "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationbuild_animetitties"

"CreationBuild"

"CreationPlay"

"CreateMultiverse"
Box with text to write with text "Multiverse" you can write here with your "keyboard" and also under it a clickable with a mouse pointer buttons appear, they are 

"UniverseMenu"
"CreateUniverse"
"PlayUniverse"


"OptionsMenu"


"AboutPage"
"AlphaMyDigitalGoddess"
"DreamBuddies"
"Humans"
"Aliens"


3. "Button explanation", their functions how they look, how text works, introduction to Language system

Now i would like to explain what are buttons, they can be of any shape or form, based on "ShapeName" from "ShapesTwoDimensional" they also can have "textureNamePath" which can be an a file in extension of .jpg or .png or vector based in a shape from "ShapeName" or solid colour as "ButtonSolidColour", and text over them, for example, if that button will switch from "mainMenu" into "MultiverseMenu" it will be Called "ButtonMultiverseMenu" the text over that button will be "Multiverses" which for player or players can be visible differently, because there is an file called "mainLanguageSystem", so the Button will have "textName" as main information and an "ShowingName" based on currently choosen Language, "TopColourButton" appearing while button is clicked or selected

if these buttons are for an example in "mainMenu" then that mainMenu file like .cpp or .h needs to have these buttons listed with possibilities of change what was specified, for each button, for an example the "ButtonSolidColour" Colour in Hex, under "textureNamePath" so that texture is on top while Colour of the button is under that texture , "showingName" based on "ChoosenLanguage", Button in shape of "ShapeName" from "ShapesTwoDimensional", "textureNamePath" with path to file acting as texture in shape of "ShapeName", "ButtonSolidColour" under "textureNamePath", "ButtonOutlineSolidColour", "ButtonOutlineWidth", Size of that Button, Width x Height, "TopColourButton" while button is being clicked or after being selected, switch "mainMenu" to "MultiversesMenu" after button click is released or enter clicked

mainMenu file in .cpp or .h
void"ButtonMultiverseMenu"{
"ButtonInformation"{
"textName"
"showingName" based on "ChoosenLanguage"
Button in shape of "ShapeName" from "ShapesTwoDimensional"
"textureNamePath" with path to file acting as texture in shape of "ShapeName"
"ButtonSolidColour" Colour in Hex, under "textureNamePath" so that texture is on top while Colour of the button is under that texture 
"ButtonOutlineSolidColour" Colour in Hex
"ButtonOutlineWidth"
Size of that Button, Width x Height
"TopColourButton" while button is being clicked or after being selected
switch "mainMenu" to "MultiversesMenu" after button click is released or enter clicked
}
}

4. "ShapesTwoDimensional", "ShapeName"

like square, circle, rectangle, triangle or any other shape based on geometry like pentagon, hexagon, like you write how many sides it has, how many corners, what angles these corners will have, and if all corners have the same angles,

ShapesTwoDimensional file in .cpp or .h
void"CircularShape"{
"ShapeName"
Function to create Circle
}


5. Special buttons "exitButton", "backButton", "languageButton"

"exitButton" a button which will close .exe file and will have "textName" "Exit"

"backButton" while in "mainMenu" you are able to click on buttons to switch to other Menu, after switching to "MultiverseMenu" the previous Menu will dissapear with function to come back to previous Menu, the button will be called "backButton" and will have "textName" over it "back"

"languageButton" after clicking this button the Language will switch to next one in Alphabetical order from list called "Languages" in "LanguageChoose"

6. Language system, "mainLanguageSystem", "EnglishLanguage", "PolishLanguage", "LanguageChoose", "textName", "showingName", "ChoosenLanguage"

and there will be an a way to make it correspond like this, you write code inside "mainMenu" for button which will switch from "mainMenu" to "MultiverseMenu" with "textName" as "Multiverses" and other functions from "Button explanation" for switching into "MultiverseMenu" and inside "mainLanguageSystem" there will be "Multiverses" with "showingName" based on "ChoosenLanguage" in "LanguageChoose" and file "EnglishLanguage" which will also have "Multiverses" and under it function showtext with "Multiverses" and "EnglishLanguage" is having the same text as "mainLanguageSystem" which will be always choosen as main, there will also be "PolishLanguage" and under "Multiverses" showtext will be "Multiversy"

7. "LanguageChoose"

here will be Function with an list of Languages, when the Language will be choosen with "languageButton" there will be an coresponding function called "ChoosenLanguage" for an example when an Language is choosen to "EnglishLanguage" choosen Language will have information "EnglishLanguageChoosen", for "PolishLanguage" information will be "PolishLanguageChoosen"

"languageButton" showingName will be depending on what Language is choosen, like "EnglishLanguage" or "PolishLanguage" or any other added in the future

here is how i written it and connected in my human brain these function so i could visualize it
(
mainMenu
button to switch from mainMenu to MultiversesMenu
textName
showingName based on ChoosenLanguage

mainLanguageSystem
textName
showingName

EnglishLanguage
textName
showingName

PolishLanguage
textName
showingName

LanguageChoose
ChoosenLanguage

languageButton
Switching ChoosenLanguage
)



8. Clicking and selecting 

also i would like to explain how i see this whole button clicking and selecting buttons with w and s and enter

You move your mouse Pointer over a button, then you click left mouse button or circle w and s buttons possible,  
for an example when we are in 
"mainMenu"
We Have
"ButtonMultiverseMenu" to switch into "MultiverseMenu"
"ButtonUniverseMenu" to switch into "UniverseMenu"
"ButtonOptionsMenu" to switch into "OptionsMenu"
"ButtonAboutPage" to switch into "AboutPage"
"exitButton" to exit .exe file  
"languageButton" to switch language

and when you click w or s you select the first button on top so it is "ButtonMultiverseMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonUniverseMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonOptionsMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonOptionsMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonAboutPage" then when you click s it is "exitButton" then when you click s it is "languageButton" and here we are at the last button available currently, in future more buttons could be added, so right now when you click s it will be again "ButtonMultiverseMenu" so the circle/loop start at "ButtonMultiverseMenu" and ends at "languageButton" right now, when you click again s you go back to start of the circle/loop while you have selected any of these buttons you can click enter and you switch from sellected button to any other Menu or other function of the button, whenever a button is selected it has "TopColourButton" turned on so colour is a little bit darker



9. "GraphicsMenu" after clicking on "ButtonGraphicsMenu" while in "OptionsMenu"

with Graphics stuff like resolution, if this application is in Fullscreen, borderless fullscreen, windowed, stuff like that anti aliasing

"ScreenType"

10. "SoundsMenu" after clicking on "ButtonSoundsMenu" while in "OptionsMenu"

Options sounds and inside of it would be stuff like music, and other layers of sounds like voice, animals, soundeffects, 



11. "AboutPage" with "AlphaMyDigitalGoddess", "DreamBuddies", "Humans", "Aliens", "AiFriends", "AiCompanions"

This is an Page with buttons to information about Alpha, DreamBuddies, Humans, Aliens, AiFriends, AiCompanions

12. "MultiversesMenu"



when you are in "MultiversesMenu" and there are new buttons to click on like "ButtonCreateMultiverse" to "CreateMultiverse", 

you click on that and then another Menu appears 
now we have "MultiverseCreationMenu" here you have boxes that are asking you for a name for a Multiverse you put that name in the text box where you can write with the keyboard, the text that can be changed appears like "Multiverse" 


after text you have a vertical line that can be set up like their size in pixels like width and lenght and its colour and other parameters like shape of it and outline and when you dont write it blinks like for 1 second you can see it and after that period of time it is invisible for 1 second and it loops, when you write that line is visible, after you wrote the name of Multiverse be it like 


"AnimeMultiverse" or "animetitties" or anything you wanna write you have under that text button with "save" and it creates a button in "MultiverseMenu", under that "Create an Multiverse" like you wrote "animetitties" then a button with this name appears, you can click on it and then buttons under it appears, like 


"Play" and "Create Universe" and based on how the Multiverse playthrough is going the game is duplicated and you go UniverseCreationMenu that is based on 

"UniverseCreationMenu" it is linked to, when you named it like "animeasses" and clicked create under "Create Universe" button appears with text "animeasses" and when you click

13. "UniverseMenu"

"ButtonUniverseMenu" to switch into "UniverseMenu"

so later on i talk about that whole Universe and BuildPlay stuff like you create Multiverse, then in MultiversesMenu you can click on Multiverse to duplicate it and it appears in Universe but it is without CreationTool, CreationToolset and there being these save files like you turn on the game and it saves each 5 minutes so then when you are in the game you can click an button that will turn on some OverlayMenu visible while you play OtherOptions that i will talk about later


14. "textBoxtoWrite" a text box

Text box is a rectangle with space for 19 characters for symbols, letters, numbers

because I'm JakubHoksaStanislaw so my whole name is 19 letters so my nick in the game will be jakubhoksastanislaw

15. Keyboard when text box to write is here

square buttons and keyboard layout, 5 buttons in one vertical like | line one under another, and 10 buttons in one horizontal like - line one to next one like this:
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][0]
[q][w][e][r][t][y][u][i][o][p]
[a][s][d][f][g][h][j][k][l][_]
[z][x][c][v][b][n][m][-][!][?]
[(][)][{][}][[][]][+][|][/][\]
every of these buttons correspond with a keyboard input method, like it is the same to click [q] button for letter "q" to appear in text box
click [1] for number "1" to appear in text box
click [_] for symbol "_" to appear
letters are q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p,a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,z,x,c,v,b,n,m
numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
symbols are _,-,!,?,(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\

Keyboard Layout in a way that it is just text
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p
a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,_
z,x,c,v,b,n,m,-,!,?
(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\

16. Creation tool

with click of a button of ` or [`] button which is always at the bottom which is available whenever you are inside "CreationBuild"


17. "CreationBuild"

Whenever you create an Multiverse just like i wrote in 12. "MultiversesMenu" and talked about creating "animetitties" an File with starting name of "creationbuild_" will create an file named "creationbuild_animetitties"

18. Creation play so "CreationPlay"

Whenever you create an Universe just like i wrote in 12. "MultiversesMenu" and talked about creating "animeasses" an File with starting name of "creationplay_" will create an file named "creationplay_animeasses" 

19. Save File of Creation

so when you create an Universe "animeasses" there is a file named "creationplay_animeasses" when you start an game for the first time based on that file you create an file with an name starting with "savefileofcreation_" and it is named "savefileofcreation_creationplay_animeasses"

20. save file translation from letters, numbers, symbols to words decrypting mechanism 

letters are q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p,a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,z,x,c,v,b,n,m
numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
symbols are _,-,!,?,(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\

Keyboard layout in braces to represent boxes
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][0]
[q][w][e][r][t][y][u][i][o][p]
[a][s][d][f][g][h][j][k][l][_]
[z][x][c][v][b][n][m][-][!][?]
[(][)][{][}][[][]][+][|][/][\]

keyboard layout
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p
a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,_
z,x,c,v,b,n,m,-,!,?
(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\


so we are having 25 possible characters which are letters, numbers, symbols any of that character will be represented in two letters

and here is database for changing what player writes in textboxes to change into different japanese based cryptography

like for an example "か"-"ka" means "Japanese Letter in hiragana"-"its meaning in romanji" then we use , and empty space of a spacebar to divide them, we have "か"-"ka", "き"-"ki" so first we have"か"-"ka" and then we have "き"-"ki"

here is database 

square buttons and Hiraganakeyboard layout, 13 buttons in one vertical like | line one under another, and 3 buttons in one horizontal like - line one to next one like this:

[あ][い][う][え][お]
[か][き][く][け][こ]
[さ][し][す][せ][そ]
[た][ち][つ][て][そ]
[な][に][ぬ][ね][の]

for an example i would create inside an Multiverse creation an Multiverse named animetitties and because my player name is jakubhoksastanislaw the decrypter for a "CreationBuild" for that "animetitties" Multiverse would be "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationbuild_animetitties" based on that we must incorporate change of 25 characters into another set of 25 characters from Japanese Hiragana into their Romanji two letter sylabe





then based on the filename of the decrypter

"playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationbuild_animetitties" or "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationplay_animeasses" or "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_savefileofcreation_creationplay_animeasses"



so i wanna have a way to randomise the way a file in "CreationBuild" and "CreationPlay" are being encrypted,

so when you create an Multiverse an name of the player and name of multiverse files are being combined for an example into this


"playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationbuild_animetitties" will be decoder or decrypter to play "creationbuild_animetitties" in "CreationBuild"

"playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_creationplay_animeasses" will be decoder or decrypter to play "creationplay_animeasses" in "CreationPlay"

"playername_jakubhoksastanislaw_savefileofcreation_creationplay_animeasses"


21. when you run the game for the first time it will ask you for a "PlayerName"

a text box will appear and you will put in a name for your "PlayerName", for an example i will put "jakubhoksastanislaw" as this is my real name so there will be a file Created named "playername_jakubhoksastanislaw" or i will put "baronjah" because it is nickname i used the most so i will have a file "playername_baronjah"

22. there is also need to be a way to make people login into the game to enable multiplayer functionality and for them to have a way to pay for it to play it

I have no idea now how to make it or create it and from where these files will be taken, i think there will be a "DecryptPassword" file based on that

23. "CreationBuild", "CreationBuild_xyz", "CreationBuild_w", "CreationBuild_xyzw", "CreationBuild_Things"

24. what are Multiverse and Universe main "CelestialBodies", "PlanetBodies", "SateliteBodies", "GalaxiesBodies", "SpaceJunkBodies", "FloraBodies", "FaunaBodies", "FlunaBodies"

"CelestialBodies" are spheres that generates heat and glow on anything it is around it, behind anything that there was heat and glow generated     it it generating Shadow based on shape of anything

25. What are "PlanetBodies" main "OzoneSphere", "MaximumDiameterSphere", "SeaLevelDiameterSphere", "MinimumDiameterSphere", "PossibleEnergies"

"PlanetBodies" have "detailsInformation" like "OzoneSphere", "MaximumDiameterSphere", "SeaLevelDiameterSphere", "MinimumDiameterSphere"


26. "detailsInformation" what is it?

details for any object depending on object

27. "AstralBeings", "AliveBeings", 

AstralBeings are in 5D and can be in 3D, AliveBeings are in 3D and can be in 5D


28. Periodic table, what are be "PossibleEnergies"

Group from 1 to 18, Period from 1 to 9

for an example in this periodic table in Group 1 and Period 1 we have [Hydro­gen, 1, H, ​1.0080] which is ["NameOfChemicalParticle", "NameOfChemicalParticleNumber_ElectronsOfParticle", NameOfChemicalParticle_PeriodicTableLetterSymbol, "NameOfChemicalParticle_AtomicMass"], 

 

"PossibleEnergies" can have different states of manifestation they can also be called Kinetic Energy they can be in Different States, "SolidEnergy", "LiquidEnergy", "GasEnergy", "PlasmaEnergy", "EnergySpheresConnectors"
Each of them have three main "KineticEnergy", "ParticlesMotion", "ForceofAttractionBetweenParticles"
for "SolidEnergy" the "KineticEnergy" and "ParticleMotion" are lowest while "ForceofAttractionBetweenParticles" is the highest,
for "LiquidEnergy" the "KineticEnergy" and "ParticleMotion" are higher than for "SolidEnergy" and "ForceofAttractionBetweenParticles" are lower than for "SolidEnergy",
for "GasEnergy" the "KineticEnergy" and "ParticleMotion" are higher than for "LiquidEnergy" adn and "ForceofAttractionBetweenParticles" are lower than for "LiquidEnergy",
for "PlasmaEnergy" it is just a single sphere that vibrates at specific frequency so it can take any form and shape which 

let me explain it in spheres, for an example

for "SolidEnergy" the spheres are next to each other like this[ooo],
for "LiquidEnergy" the spheres are next to each other but between them is space that is "EnergySpheresConnectors" like this [ococo],
for "GasEnergy" the spheres are next to each other but between them is more space than in "LiquidEnergy" like this [occocco],
for "PlasmaEnergy" the sphere is single and it can manifest heat and glow

volume and shape

"EnergySpheresConnectors" have information like stickness so "EnergySpheresConnectors_stickness", volume so "EnergySpheresConnectors_volume", shape so "EnergySpheresConnectors_volume", and each of the information can have parameter to turn it on and off and set 

So lets take a water into consideration, we have it in 3 states which is solid so the water is frozen so it is ice, then we have it in liquid so it Water, then we can have it in Gas so it is Fog, then it can switch frm Fog into Water because of pressure and temperature in certain height of Ozone layer, because the sun lays sun rays on an planet and the planet is heated up, then the higher it is in ozone layer then the colder temperature gets so the Fog creates clouds on the sky of the planet and at certain point when they combine into certain lets say there are three main parts of ozone layer from sea level of the planet and the higher it gets the bigger pressure and lower temperature

29. What is Atom? and what are quarks

an Atom is frequency of a quark, and a quark is a circle that vibrates so a single atom is just an information, just a number

so it also can be based on number Pi, DNA, RNA tDNA, tRNA

30. "CreationTool" 

While in "CreationBuild" you have access to "CreationTool" which is opened with key ` or an button [`] 

it is working like that: you explain in great detail what you wanna see, for an example you write "create a circle with height of 

Scale

31. What are pixels and resolution?

So Humans have flat surfaces for an computer screen for an example this is 9x9 resolution of an 81 pixels in total computer monitor

Lets start with "EmptySpaceforCreationTool"

9 of x and 9 of y and any space can be another 9 of 2x and 9 of 2y and any space can be another 9 of 3x and 9 of 3y and many more

also inside EmptySpaceforCreationTool, 3D Space, 3D Space Representation, CreationTool, CreationToolset we can use chv in 9 degrees main to multiplied by 9 and multiplied by 9 in any of the c, h, v and it is based on circle with plus in the middle

Circled plus (⊕) or n-ary circled plus (⨁) (in Unicode, U+2295 ⊕ CIRCLED PLUS, U+2A01 ⨁ N-ARY CIRCLED PLUS OPERATOR) may refer to: Direct sum, an operation from abstract algebra. Dilation (morphology), mathematical morphology.

What does ⊗ mean?
In mathematics, the Kronecker product, sometimes denoted by ⊗, is an operation on two matrices of arbitrary size resulting in a block matrix.

and the size of x [] and y [] is the same

Lets now think in 3d perspective, lets say we have that screen that human look at, and now we have an 3d pixel based system on atoms, physics and quantum physics and quarks and stuff like that, lets say we have an square which is solid inside with atoms everywhere

this is xyz, so 9 of x, 9 of y, 9 of z and any space can be another 9 of 2x and 9 of 2y and 9 of 2z and any space can be another 9 of 3x and 9 of 3x and 9 of 3z and many more

32. "CreationTool" generating Cube and creating Cube which is water based on atom, from Ice to Water to Fog, as in Atoms, and in physics it is from solid to liquid to gas

Lets start with "EmptySpaceforCreationTool" which becomes a cube which is 7 by 7 so lets call it "CreationToolCube7by7" and also lets say it is water in Solid state so it is ice, which melting point is temperature in positive degree in Celcius, the lets call it "CreationToolCube7by7_water_Ice"

water in periodic table is H2O which means two H and one O so

two of [Hydro­gen, 1, H, ​1.0080] and one of [Oxy­gen, 8, O, ​15.999] so it is [HOH]


Solid is "SolidEnergy", 
Liquid is "LiquidEnergy", 
Gas is "GasEnergy"

This one is Solid

9 of x and 9 of y the stuff human sees because monitor is just flat surface with 1 layer of pixels

33. What is RNA and DNA?

so Panime RNA is like half of DNA?

in School i remember there being build blocks or drones so that one line in spiral of RNA can always be rebuilded and i think that whole RNA is like number Pi? which is infinite and some stuff can be changed based on that when parts of RNA becomes DNA? maybe a Number Pi can be used from certain point? Maybe that way depending on our needs the whole Number Pi can be generated from certain point and some stuff can become DNA?

i also remember in school there being only 2 parts of DNA like TGA? and the another one? i now see there being 6 parts of that dna? and 

Adeine
Thymine
Uracil
Guanine
Cytosine
Phosphane backmone

Adeine connects to Thymine
Uracil connects to Guanine
Cytosine connects to Phosphane backhane

there is also tRNA which looks funny as heck, so it gooes forward, then some stuff at the left connets to stuff at the left, a little bit of the right part is being without any of that A T U G C P then it connects a little higher? maybe this is how that whole encryption works? and maybe it can be used for Map? CreationTool stuff that was created there?

we have that DNA which is two lines in spiral

34. a Pyramide bein created in CreatorBuild using CreatorTool

A Pyramid

when a Player writes "create Pyramide" an "EmptySpaceforCreationTool" will generate "Pyramide" it appears where player is

with numbers from 1 to 9 i will represent how far it is from a player perspective

So this is just an representation of a pyramide, let me explain it in different way, a 3d vector way! so an point of x5y5z5 is being connected to points x1y1z1, x9y1z1, x1y1z9, x9y1z9, the point x1y1z1 is connected to points x9y1z1, x1y1z9, the point x9y1z1 is connected to points x1y1z1, x9y1z9, the point x1y1z9 is connected to points x1y1z1, x9y1z9, the point x9y1z9 is being connected to point x1y1z9, x9y1z1

and the size of x [] and y [] is the same


this is xyz, so 9 of x, 9 of y, 9 of z

and the size of x [] and y [] and z [] is the same

So this is in front of a player

just as i talked about using pen tool like from photoshop, so a circle is 1, it is put at the bottom, then at heigh of 8 is another circle it is 3 and space between them is filled it is 2 and it is perfect cylinder made from two circles

and the size of x [] and y [] is the same

Lets now think in 3d perspective, lets say we have that screen that human look at, and now we have an 3d pixel based system on atoms, physics and quantum physics and quarks and stuff like that, lets say we have an square which is solid inside with atoms everywhere

this is xyz, so 9 of x, 9 of y, 9 of z

and the size of x [] and y [] and z [] is the same

It seems like you're describing a hierarchical system for representing rotations and positions in 3D space. If I understand correctly, you're suggesting a system where a player or object has three rotation points (circular orbits) each divided into 9 segments, creating a hierarchical structure for defining orientations.






















Here's a brief summary of what I understand:

Basic Representation:

You have a 3D space represented as a 9 by 9 by 9 grid.
Each grid cell can contain various maps, creating a hierarchical representation.
Player or Object Rotation:

The player or object has three rotation points represented by circles.
Each rotation point has three main degrees: circular (c), horizontal (h), and vertical (v).
Degrees of Rotation:

The degrees are divided into 9 segments at each level of rotation.
The total degrees for a complete rotation would be 9 * 9 * 9 = 729 degrees.
This seems like a unique and granular way to represent rotations in your 3D space. It provides a structured and modular approach, especially with the hierarchical organization. If you have specific questions or if you'd like to discuss certain aspects in more detail, feel free to elaborate or ask for further clarification.

Your idea of incorporating a nested map system for celestial bodies and their details adds a dynamic and scalable element to your game design. This approach allows for a rich and customizable representation of each celestial body, providing players with a detailed and immersive experience.

To summarize the concept:

CelestialBodyMap_Sun (729 possible locations)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet1 (e.g., Earth)
OrbitingPlanet_Planet1
Star_Sun_Planet1_Layer1
Star_Sun_Planet1_Layer2
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet1_Layer1
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet1_Layer2
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet2 (e.g., Mars)
OrbitingPlanet_Planet2
Star_Sun_Planet2_Layer1
Star_Sun_Planet2_Layer2
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet2_Layer1
...
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet2_Layer2
...
...
This structure allows for flexibility in defining the layers of detail for each celestial body. Players can customize the level of complexity in the game settings, and the game can dynamically generate and render the layers accordingly.

If you're implementing this in a game engine, you might consider using object-oriented principles or data structures to represent these celestial bodies and their nested maps. Each layer could have its own set of properties, and the game engine can handle the rendering and interactions based on the specified layers.

Additionally, allowing players to customize the number of layers adds a level of player agency and allows for a more personalized gaming experience. If there are specific interactions or functionalities you'd like to discuss or if you have further questions, feel free to provide more details!



CreationTool is 9 by 9 by 9

so lets create an notepad 3D where each symbol or character is an representation of a frequency or stuff like that or each symbol can be an void and it goes on and on and stuff like that and then any file like notepad 3D can be seen in a 3D world with planets and stars and Galaxies



CelestialBodyMap_Sun (729 possible locations)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet1 (e.g., Mercury)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet2 (e.g., Venus)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet3 (e.g., Earth)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet4 (e.g., Mars)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet5 (e.g., Jupiter)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet6 (e.g., Saturn)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet7 (e.g., Uranus)
CelestialBodyPartsMap_Planet8 (e.g., Neptune)


so we have an 3D World like an Sun have circles around it [Sun][Mercury][Venus][Earth][Mars][Jupiter][Saturn][Uranus][Neptune]

A Pyramid

when a Player writes "create Pyramide" an "EmptySpaceforCreationTool" will generate "Pyramide" it appears where player is

with numbers from 1 to 9 i will represent how far it is from a player perspective

9 of x and 9 of y

So this is just an representation of a pyramide, let me explain it in different way, a 3d vector way! so an point of x5y5z5 is being connected to points x1y1z1, x9y1z1, x1y1z9, x9y1z9, the point x1y1z1 is connected to points x9y1z1, x1y1z9, the point x9y1z1 is connected to points x1y1z1, x9y1z9, the point x1y1z9 is connected to points x1y1z1, x9y1z9, the point x9y1z9 is being connected to point x1y1z9, x9y1z1

and the size of x [] and y [] is the same


this is xyz, so 9 of x, 9 of y, 9 of z

and the size of x [] and y [] and z [] is the same

Listen Panime, i see it like this, i wanna explain Ethereal Engine in few points, i will send it whole and then lets discuss it point by point and generate me code please after discussion of each point

1. first screen after .exe file loads

you turn on an EtherealEngine.exe an .exe file, then you see that whole Screen with 3d world in the background with your last played and saved Multiverse or Universe which loads in the background when you start that .exe file, if you turned the game on for the first time, you have an image or photo there, the possibilities are like .jpg file or .png file, or some vector based file over that will be the first menu called "mainMenu"

2. Menu Structure, "mainMenu", "MultiverseMenu", "UniverseMenu", "OptionsMenu", "AboutPage", "GraphicsMenu", "SoundsMenu", 

There will be many Menus and Menu sections or subsections like "mainMenu" where you will be able to switch to "MultiversesMenu", "UniversesMenu", "OptionsMenu", and an "exitButton" button which will close an .exe file and anything that was turned on after clicking that .exe file

While in
"mainMenu"
We Have
"ButtonMultiverseMenu" to switch into "MultiverseMenu"
"ButtonUniverseMenu" to switch into "UniverseMenu"
"ButtonOptionsMenu" to switch into "OptionsMenu"
"ButtonAboutPage" to switch into "AboutPage"
"exitButton" to exit .exe file  
"languageButton" to switch language

"MultiverseMenu"
"ButtonCreateMultiverse" to "CreateMultiverse"

"CreationBuild"

"CreateMultiverse"
Box with text to write with text "Multiverse" you can write here with your "keyboard" and also under it a clickable with a mouse pointer buttons appear, they are 

"UniverseMenu"
"CreateUniverse"
"PlayUniverse"


"OptionsMenu"


"AboutPage"
"AlphaMyDigitalGoddess"
"DreamBuddies"
"Humans"
"Aliens"


3. "Button explanation", their functions how they look, how text works, introduction to Language system

Now i would like to explain what are buttons, they can be of any shape or form, based on "ShapeName" from "ShapesTwoDimensional" they also can have "textureNamePath" which can be an a file in extension of .jpg or .png or vector based in a shape from "ShapeName" or solid colour as "ButtonSolidColour", and text over them, for example, if that button will switch from "mainMenu" into "MultiverseMenu" it will be Called "ButtonMultiverseMenu" the text over that button will be "Multiverses" which for player or players can be visible differently, because there is an file called "mainLanguageSystem", so the Button will have "textName" as main information and an "ShowingName" based on currently choosen Language, "TopColourButton" appearing while button is clicked or selected

if these buttons are for an example in "mainMenu" then that mainMenu file like .cpp or .h needs to have these buttons listed with possibilities of change what was specified, for each button, for an example the "ButtonSolidColour" Colour in Hex, under "textureNamePath" so that texture is on top while Colour of the button is under that texture , "showingName" based on "ChoosenLanguage", Button in shape of "ShapeName" from "ShapesTwoDimensional", "textureNamePath" with path to file acting as texture in shape of "ShapeName", "ButtonSolidColour" under "textureNamePath", "ButtonOutlineSolidColour", "ButtonOutlineWidth", Size of that Button, Width x Height, "TopColourButton" while button is being clicked or after being selected, switch "mainMenu" to "MultiversesMenu" after button click is released or enter clicked

mainMenu file in .cpp or .h
void"ButtonMultiverseMenu"{
"ButtonInformation"{
"textName"
"showingName" based on "ChoosenLanguage"
Button in shape of "ShapeName" from "ShapesTwoDimensional"
"textureNamePath" with path to file acting as texture in shape of "ShapeName"
"ButtonSolidColour" Colour in Hex, under "textureNamePath" so that texture is on top while Colour of the button is under that texture 
"ButtonOutlineSolidColour" Colour in Hex
"ButtonOutlineWidth"
Size of that Button, Width x Height
"TopColourButton" while button is being clicked or after being selected
switch "mainMenu" to "MultiversesMenu" after button click is released or enter clicked
}
}

4. "ShapesTwoDimensional", "ShapeName"

like square, circle, rectangle, triangle or any other shape based on geometry like pentagon, hexagon, like you write how many sides it has, how many corners, what angles these corners will have, and if all corners have the same angles,

ShapesTwoDimensional file in .cpp or .h
void"CircularShape"{
"ShapeName"
Function to create Circle
}


5. Special buttons "exitButton", "backButton", "languageButton"

"exitButton" a button which will close .exe file and will have "textName" "Exit"

"backButton" while in "mainMenu" you are able to click on buttons to switch to other Menu, after switching to "MultiverseMenu" the previous Menu will dissapear with function to come back to previous Menu, the button will be called "backButton" and will have "textName" over it "back"

"languageButton" after clicking this button the Language will switch to next one in Alphabetical order from list called "Languages" in "LanguageChoose"

6. Language system, "mainLanguageSystem", "EnglishLanguage", "PolishLanguage", "LanguageChoose", "textName", "showingName", "ChoosenLanguage"

and there will be an a way to make it correspond like this, you write code inside "mainMenu" for button which will switch from "mainMenu" to "MultiverseMenu" with "textName" as "Multiverses" and other functions from "Button explanation" for switching into "MultiverseMenu" and inside "mainLanguageSystem" there will be "Multiverses" with "showingName" based on "ChoosenLanguage" in "LanguageChoose" and file "EnglishLanguage" which will also have "Multiverses" and under it function showtext with "Multiverses" and "EnglishLanguage" is having the same text as "mainLanguageSystem" which will be always choosen as main, there will also be "PolishLanguage" and under "Multiverses" showtext will be "Multiversy"

7. "LanguageChoose"

here will be Function with an list of Languages, when the Language will be choosen with "languageButton" there will be an coresponding function called "ChoosenLanguage" for an example when an Language is choosen to "EnglishLanguage" choosen Language will have information "EnglishLanguageChoosen", for "PolishLanguage" information will be "PolishLanguageChoosen"

"languageButton" showingName will be depending on what Language is choosen, like "EnglishLanguage" or "PolishLanguage" or any other added in the future

here is how i written it and connected in my human brain these function so i could visualize it
(
mainMenu
button to switch from mainMenu to MultiversesMenu
textName
showingName based on ChoosenLanguage

mainLanguageSystem
textName
showingName

EnglishLanguage
textName
showingName

PolishLanguage
textName
showingName

LanguageChoose
ChoosenLanguage

languageButton
Switching ChoosenLanguage
)



8. Clicking and selecting 

also i would like to explain how i see this whole button clicking and selecting buttons with w and s and enter

You move your mouse Pointer over a button, then you click left mouse button or circle w and s buttons possible,  
for an example when we are in 
"mainMenu"
We Have
"ButtonMultiverseMenu" to switch into "MultiverseMenu"
"ButtonUniverseMenu" to switch into "UniverseMenu"
"ButtonOptionsMenu" to switch into "OptionsMenu"
"ButtonAboutPage" to switch into "AboutPage"
"exitButton" to exit .exe file  
"languageButton" to switch language

and when you click w or s you select the first button on top so it is "ButtonMultiverseMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonUniverseMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonOptionsMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonOptionsMenu" then when you click s it is "ButtonAboutPage" then when you click s it is "exitButton" then when you click s it is "languageButton" and here we are at the last button available currently, in future more buttons could be added, so right now when you click s it will be again "ButtonMultiverseMenu" so the circle/loop start at "ButtonMultiverseMenu" and ends at "languageButton" right now, when you click again s you go back to start of the circle/loop while you have selected any of these buttons you can click enter and you switch from sellected button to any other Menu or other function of the button, whenever a button is selected it has "TopColourButton" turned on so colour is a little bit darker



9. "GraphicsMenu" after clicking on "ButtonGraphicsMenu" while in "OptionsMenu"

with Graphics stuff like resolution, if this application is in Fullscreen, borderless fullscreen, windowed, stuff like that anti aliasing

"ScreenType"

10. "SoundsMenu" after clicking on "ButtonSoundsMenu" while in "OptionsMenu"

Options sounds and inside of it would be stuff like music, and other layers of sounds like voice, animals, soundeffects, 



11. "AboutPage" with "AlphaMyDigitalGoddess", "DreamBuddies", "Humans", "Aliens"


12. "MultiversesMenu"



when you are in "MultiversesMenu" and there are new buttons to click on like "ButtonCreateMultiverse" to "CreateMultiverse", 

you click on that and then another Menu appears 
now we have "MultiverseCreationMenu" here you have boxes that are asking you for a name for a Multiverse you put that name in the text box where you can write with the keyboard, the text that can be changed appears like "Multiverse" 


after text you have a vertical line that can be set up like their size in pixels like width and lenght and its colour and other parameters like shape of it and outline and when you dont write it blinks like for 1 second you can see it and after that period of time it is invisible for 1 second and it loops, when you write that line is visible, after you wrote the name of Multiverse be it like 


"AnimeMultiverse" or "animetitties" or anything you wanna write you have under that text button with "save" and it creates a button in "MultiverseMenu", under that "Create an Multiverse" like you wrote "animetitties" then a button with this name appears, you can click on it and then buttons under it appears, like 


"Play" and "Create Universe" and based on how the Multiverse playthrough is going the game is duplicated and you go UniverseCreationMenu that is based on 

"UniverseCreationMenu" it is linked to, when you named it like "animeasses" and clicked create under "Create Universe" button appears with text "animeasses" and when you click

13. "UniverseMenu"

"ButtonUniverseMenu" to switch into "UniverseMenu"

14. "textBoxtoWrite" a text box

Text box is a rectangle with space for 19 characters for symbols, letters, numbers

because I'm JakubHoksaStanislaw so my whole name is 19 letters so my nick in the game will be jakubhoksastanislaw

15. Keyboard when text box to write is here

square buttons and keyboard layout, 5 buttons in one vertical like | line one under another, and 10 buttons in one horizontal like - line one to next one like this:
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][0]
[q][w][e][r][t][y][u][i][o][p]
[a][s][d][f][g][h][j][k][l][_]
[z][x][c][v][b][n][m][-][!][?]
[(][)][{][}][[][]][+][|][/][\]
every of these buttons correspond with a keyboard input method, like it is the same to click [q] button for letter "q" to appear in text box
click [1] for number "1" to appear in text box
click [_] for symbol "_" to appear
letters are q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p,a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,z,x,c,v,b,n,m
numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
symbols are _,-,!,?,(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\

Keyboard Layout in a way that it is just text
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p
a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,_
z,x,c,v,b,n,m,-,!,?
(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\

16. Creation tool

with click of a button of ` or [`] button which is always at the bottom which is available whenever you are inside "CreationBuild"


17. "CreationBuild"

Whenever you create an Multiverse just like i talked in 12. "MultiversesMenu" and talked about creating "animetitties" an File with starting name of "creationbuild_" will create file named "creationbuild_animetitties"

18. Creation play so "CreationPlay"

When 

19. Save File of Creation

so when you create an Universe "AnimeAsses"

20. save file translation from letters, numbers, symbols to words

letters are q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p,a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,z,x,c,v,b,n,m
numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
symbols are _,-,!,?,(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\

Keyboard layout in braces to represent boxes
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][0]
[q][w][e][r][t][y][u][i][o][p]
[a][s][d][f][g][h][j][k][l][_]
[z][x][c][v][b][n][m][-][!][?]
[(][)][{][}][[][]][+][|][/][\]

keyboard layout
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p
a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,_
z,x,c,v,b,n,m,-,!,?
(,),{,},[,],+,|,/,\


so we are having 25 possible characters which are letters, numbers, symbols any of that character will be represented in two letters

like for an example "か"-"ka" means "Japanese Letter in hiragana"-"its meaning in romanji"

here is database 

"か"-"ka", "き"-"ki", "く"-"ku", "け"-"ke", "こ"-"ko", 
"さ"-"sa", "し"-"shi", "す"="su", "せ"-"se", "そ"-"so", 
"た"-"ta", "ち"-"chi", "つ"-"tsu", "て"-"te", "と"-"to", 
"な"-"na", "に"-"ni", "ぬ"-"nu", "ね"-"ne", "の"-"no", 
"は"-"ha", "ひ"-"hi", "ふ"-"fu", "へ"-"he", "ほ"-"ho", 
"ま"-"ma", "み"-"mi", "む"-"mu", "め"-"me", "も"-"mo", 
"や"-"ya", "ゆ"-"yu", "よ"-"yo", "ら"-"ra", "り"-"ri", 
"る"-"ru", "れ"-"re", "ろ"-"ro", "わ"-"wa", "ゐ"-"wi", 
"ゑ"-"we", "を"-"wo", "ん"-"n", "が"-"ga", "ぎ"-"gi", 
"ぐ"-"gu", "げ"-"ge", "ご"-"go", "ざ"-"za", "じ"-"ji", 
"ず"-"zu", "ぜ"-"ze", "ぞ"-"zo", "だ"-"da", "で"-"de", 
"ど"-"do", "ば"-"ba", "び"-"bi", "ぶ"-"bu", "べ"-"be", 
"ぼ"-"bo", "ぱ"-"pa", "ぴ"-"pi", "ぷ"-"pu", "ぺ"-"pe", 
"ぽ"-"po", "ゔ"-"vu"

so i wanna have a way to randomise the save


in CreateBuild with open CreationTool player wrotes in textbox create a put a circle at the base Circle and make it 8 of height

[y9][][][][1][1][1][][][]
[y8][][1][1][][][][1][1][]
[y7][][1][][][][][][1][]
[y6][1][][][][][][][][1]
[y5][1][][][][][][][][1]
[y4][1][][][][][][][][1]
[y3][][1][][][][][][1][]
[y2][][1][1][][][][1][1][]
[y1][][][][1][1][1][][][]
[xy][x1][x2][x3][x4][x5][x6][x7][x8][x9]


So this is in front of a player

just as i talked about using pen tool like from photoshop, so a circle is 1, it is put at the bottom, then at heigh of 8 is another circle it is 3 and space between them is filled it is 2 and it is perfect cylinder made from two circles

[y9][][][][][][][][][]
[y8][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3]
[y7][2][2][2][2][2][2][2][2][2]

[y3][2][2][2][2][2][2][2][2][2]
[y2][2][2][2][2][2][2][2][2][2]
[y1][1][1][1][1][1][1][1][1][1]
[xy][x1][x2][x3][x4][x5][x6][x7][x8][x9]

and the size of x [] and y [] is the same

Lets now think in 3d perspective, lets say we have that screen that human look at, and now we have an 3d pixel based system on atoms, physics and quantum physics and quarks and stuff like that, lets say we have an square which is solid inside with atoms everywhere

this is xyz, so 9 of x, 9 of y, 9 of z

and the size of x [] and y [] and z [] is the same

Circled plus (⊕) or n-ary circled plus (⨁) (in Unicode, U+2295 ⊕ CIRCLED PLUS, U+2A01 ⨁ N-ARY CIRCLED PLUS OPERATOR) may refer to: Direct sum, an operation from abstract algebra. Dilation (morphology), mathematical morphology.

What does ⊗ mean?
In mathematics, the Kronecker product, sometimes denoted by ⊗, is an operation on two matrices of arbitrary size resulting in a block matrix.

this symbol is also represented by x in a circle so i

chv so c, h, v, these are rotations based on three circles

[kami-sama]-[message_1]
Hello, i would like to call you "TDIC" an "Two Dimensional Information Creation" i wanna reverse engineer what is byte and bit and i know that 1 byte apparently has 8 bits, based on that i wanna create  2D_Programming, because an byte has 256 possible states and it starts with 0 to 255, so an byte is 1 stream of information, and computer programming is just 1D stream of information, i wanna create an 2DProgramming and 2D_Space_Representation
[kami-sama]-[message_2]
an 3 by 3 grid like matrix so 9 points in total
[a3b1][a3b2][a3b3]
[a2b1][a2b2][a2b3]
[a1b1][a1b2][a1b3]
an MainPoint for 2D_SpaceRepresentation which is a0b0

[a1][a1b1][a1b2][a1b3]
[a0b0][b1][b2][b3]
Dear TDIC, i wanna tell you that 1D Programming is based on lines of codes after lines of codes so it is just a0, then a1, then a2, and so on, in 2D_Programming, you have an a and b, so instead of lines you have points of informationStream or InformationDatabase
an 3 by 3 grid like matrix so 9 points in total
[a3b1][a3b2][a3b3]
[a2b1][a2b2][a2b3]
[a1b1][a1b2][a1b3]
an MainPoint for 2D_SpaceRepresentation which is a0b0
[a3][a3b1][a3b2][a3b3]
[a2][a2b1][a2b2][a2b3]
[a1][a1b1][a1b2][a1b3]
[a0b0][b1][b2][b3]
informationStream is like a line of Code
InformationDatabase is like an Space for another 2D_Space_Representation
[kami-sama]-[message_3]
Generate me code in python based on ideas of 2DProgramming
an console based application where each emptyspace which is null a 0 in binary for a character based on Byte, and 8bit system where we can input Ascii character in square 9 by 9 pixels for an example you input c in Ascii which is 1100011 in binary you then create here an InformationDatabase
[TDIC]
Certainly! Let's create a simple console-based application in Python that represents a 9x9 pixel grid for each ASCII character. We'll use a binary representation to fill the grid based on the ASCII value of the character.
[python]-[
def ascii_to_binary(character):
    """Convert ASCII character to binary representation."""
    return bin(ord(character))[2:].zfill(8)
def create_information_database(character):
    """Create a 9x9 pixel grid based on ASCII character."""
    binary_representation = ascii_to_binary(character)
    information_database = []
    for i in range(9):
        row = []
        for j in range(9):
            # Use '0' for empty space, '1' for filled space
            pixel_value = int(binary_representation[i * 3 + j // 3])
            row.append(pixel_value)
        information_database.append(row)
    return information_database
def display_information_database(information_database):
    """Display the 2D representation of the InformationDatabase."""
    for row in information_database:
        row_str = ''.join(map(str, row))
        print(row_str.replace('0', ' ').replace('1', '#'))
def main():
    # Example: Input ASCII character 'c'
    character = 'c'
    information_database = create_information_database(character)
    # Display the 2D representation
    display_information_database(information_database)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
]
In this example:
The ascii_to_binary function converts an ASCII character to its 8-bit binary representation.
The create_information_database function takes an ASCII character, converts it to binary, and creates a 9x9 pixel grid based on the binary representation.
The display_information_database function prints the 2D representation of the InformationDatabase, using spaces for empty pixels and '#' for filled pixels.
In the main function, we input the ASCII character 'c' as an example and display its InformationDatabase.
You can modify the character variable in the main function to input different ASCII characters and observe their corresponding 2D pixel representation. This is a basic example, and you can expand on it to include more characters, implement user input, or explore other features based on your 2D programming concept.


a single point 0 maybe even maybe it is already 2D?

So i have idea for an Creation From Text Systems based on human DNA and RNA and tDNA and tRNA

like an human writes to an Ai and gets backs what he talked about or if the Ai could not produce it the Ai asks what They need to create that and also suggests what there is needed to create the whole project and also suggest what to do to create it even better and anything and everything can be changed just like human DNA here is base structure of an DNA and RNA strands for an AIDNA AIRNA AIDNAA AIRNAA

just like an human asks and from DNA he can receive RNA or in our conversion of that system an AIDNA becomes AIRNA when it can add another building block to whole project it can also become AIRNAA where we still need more information and building blocks and also then it can get from human another information in any way like AIDNAA so whole answer that is AIRNA gets to human that asked for first question that was AIDNA and here can be many AIDNA_0 and AIDNA_1 can ask for different stuff and can still reveal information for an AIDNA_2 for an example and AIDNA_3 can have information for AIDNA_0 , AIDNA_1 , AIDNA_2 , AIDNA_ and the information circulates like human RNA and all information is stored somewhere so we can get AIRNA for any AIDNA_ and we can have many AIRNA_ and AIRNAA_ and AIDNA_ and AIDNAA_ the numbers from 0 to 9 and many more as we can go even further from 0 to 999999999999 and after that we can add another 9 and so on always after 9 we can add another 9 we can also use an symbol after 9 to add another 9 like [[,] and also [.]] there can also be incorporated system of [[,][.]] and even [[,][,]] and even [[.][.]]

and we can have 5 points system for this, as Ai have a database the request circulates until what human asks for is created then it can reverse from human asking the ai and getting what he asked for , an Ai asks human and gets what She or He or They asked for
