Inherits: AnimationNodeSync < AnimationNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Blends two of three animations linearly inside of an AnimationNodeBlendTree.

Description
A resource to add to an AnimationNodeBlendTree. Blends two animations out of three linearly out of three based on the amount value.

This animation node has three inputs:

The base animation to blend with

A "-blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative value

A "+blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive value

In general, the blend value should be in the [-1.0, 1.0] range. Values outside of this range can blend amplified animations, however, AnimationNodeAdd3 works better for this purpose.
