PackedInt64Array
A packed array of 64-bit integers.

Description
An array specifically designed to hold 64-bit integer values. Packs data tightly, so it saves memory for large array sizes.

Note: This type stores signed 64-bit integers, which means it can take values in the interval [-2^63, 2^63 - 1], i.e. [-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807]. Exceeding those bounds will wrap around. If you only need to pack 32-bit integers tightly, see PackedInt32Array for a more memory-friendly alternative.

Differences between packed arrays, typed arrays, and untyped arrays: Packed arrays are generally faster to iterate on and modify compared to a typed array of the same type (e.g. PackedInt64Array versus Array[int]). Also, packed arrays consume less memory. As a downside, packed arrays are less flexible as they don't offer as many convenience methods such as Array.map(). Typed arrays are in turn faster to iterate on and modify than untyped arrays.

Note: Packed arrays are always passed by reference. To get a copy of an array that can be modified independently of the original array, use duplicate(). This is not the case for built-in properties and methods. The returned packed array of these are a copies, and changing it will not affect the original value. To update a built-in property you need to modify the returned array, and then assign it to the property again.

Note

There are notable differences when using this API with C#. See C# API differences to GDScript for more information.

Constructor Descriptions
PackedInt64Array PackedInt64Array() 

Constructs an empty PackedInt64Array.

PackedInt64Array PackedInt64Array(from: PackedInt64Array)

Constructs a PackedInt64Array as a copy of the given PackedInt64Array.

PackedInt64Array PackedInt64Array(from: Array)

Constructs a new PackedInt64Array. Optionally, you can pass in a generic Array that will be converted.

Method Descriptions
bool append(value: int) 

Appends an element at the end of the array (alias of push_back()).

void append_array(array: PackedInt64Array) 

Appends a PackedInt64Array at the end of this array.

int bsearch(value: int, before: bool = true) 

Finds the index of an existing value (or the insertion index that maintains sorting order, if the value is not yet present in the array) using binary search. Optionally, a before specifier can be passed. If false, the returned index comes after all existing entries of the value in the array.

Note: Calling bsearch() on an unsorted array results in unexpected behavior.

void clear() 

Clears the array. This is equivalent to using resize() with a size of 0.

int count(value: int) const 

Returns the number of times an element is in the array.

PackedInt64Array duplicate() 

Creates a copy of the array, and returns it.

void fill(value: int) 

Assigns the given value to all elements in the array. This can typically be used together with resize() to create an array with a given size and initialized elements.

int find(value: int, from: int = 0) const 

Searches the array for a value and returns its index or -1 if not found. Optionally, the initial search index can be passed.

int get(index: int) const 

Returns the 64-bit integer at the given index in the array. This is the same as using the [] operator (array[index]).

bool has(value: int) const 

Returns true if the array contains value.

int insert(at_index: int, value: int) 

Inserts a new integer at a given position in the array. The position must be valid, or at the end of the array (idx == size()).

bool is_empty() const 

Returns true if the array is empty.

bool push_back(value: int) 

Appends a value to the array.

void remove_at(index: int) 

Removes an element from the array by index.

int resize(new_size: int) 

Sets the size of the array. If the array is grown, reserves elements at the end of the array. If the array is shrunk, truncates the array to the new size. Calling resize() once and assigning the new values is faster than adding new elements one by one.

void reverse() 

Reverses the order of the elements in the array.

int rfind(value: int, from: int = -1) const 

Searches the array in reverse order. Optionally, a start search index can be passed. If negative, the start index is considered relative to the end of the array.

void set(index: int, value: int) 

Changes the integer at the given index.

int size() const 

Returns the number of elements in the array.

PackedInt64Array slice(begin: int, end: int = 2147483647) const 

Returns the slice of the PackedInt64Array, from begin (inclusive) to end (exclusive), as a new PackedInt64Array.

The absolute value of begin and end will be clamped to the array size, so the default value for end makes it slice to the size of the array by default (i.e. arr.slice(1) is a shorthand for arr.slice(1, arr.size())).

If either begin or end are negative, they will be relative to the end of the array (i.e. arr.slice(0, -2) is a shorthand for arr.slice(0, arr.size() - 2)).

void sort() 

Sorts the elements of the array in ascending order.

PackedByteArray to_byte_array() const 

Returns a copy of the data converted to a PackedByteArray, where each element has been encoded as 8 bytes.

The size of the new array will be int64_array.size() * 8.

Operator Descriptions
bool operator !=(right: PackedInt64Array) 

Returns true if contents of the arrays differ.

PackedInt64Array operator +(right: PackedInt64Array) 

Returns a new PackedInt64Array with contents of right added at the end of this array. For better performance, consider using append_array() instead.

bool operator ==(right: PackedInt64Array) 

Returns true if contents of both arrays are the same, i.e. they have all equal ints at the corresponding indices.

int operator [](index: int) 

Returns the int at index index. Negative indices can be used to access the elements starting from the end. Using index out of array's bounds will result in an error.
