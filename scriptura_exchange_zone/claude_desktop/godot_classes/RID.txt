RID
A handle for a Resource's unique identifier.

Description
The RID Variant type is used to access a low-level resource by its unique ID. RIDs are opaque, which means they do not grant access to the resource by themselves. They are used by the low-level server classes, such as DisplayServer, RenderingServer, TextServer, etc.

A low-level resource may correspond to a high-level Resource, such as Texture or Mesh.

Note: RIDs are only useful during the current session. It won't correspond to a similar resource if sent over a network, or loaded from a file at a later time.

Note

There are notable differences when using this API with C#. See C# API differences to GDScript for more information.

Constructor Descriptions
RID RID() 

Constructs an empty RID with the invalid ID 0.

RID RID(from: RID)

Constructs a RID as a copy of the given RID.

Method Descriptions
int get_id() const 

Returns the ID of the referenced low-level resource.

bool is_valid() const 

Returns true if the RID is not 0.

Operator Descriptions
bool operator !=(right: RID) 

Returns true if the RIDs are not equal.

bool operator <(right: RID) 

Returns true if the RID's ID is less than right's ID.

bool operator <=(right: RID) 

Returns true if the RID's ID is less than or equal to right's ID.

bool operator ==(right: RID) 

Returns true if both RIDs are equal, which means they both refer to the same low-level resource.

bool operator >(right: RID) 

Returns true if the RID's ID is greater than right's ID.

bool operator >=(right: RID) 

Returns true if the RID's ID is greater than or equal to right's ID.
