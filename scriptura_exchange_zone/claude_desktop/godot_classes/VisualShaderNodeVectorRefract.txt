Inherits: VisualShaderNodeVectorBase < VisualShaderNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Returns the vector that points in the direction of refraction. For use within the visual shader graph.

Description
Translated to refract(I, N, eta) in the shader language, where I is the incident vector, N is the normal vector and eta is the ratio of the indices of the refraction.
