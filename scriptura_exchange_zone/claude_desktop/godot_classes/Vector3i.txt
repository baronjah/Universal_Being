Vector3i
A 3D vector using integer coordinates.

Description
A 3-element structure that can be used to represent 3D grid coordinates or any other triplet of integers.

It uses integer coordinates and is therefore preferable to Vector3 when exact precision is required. Note that the values are limited to 32 bits, and unlike Vector3 this cannot be configured with an engine build option. Use int or PackedInt64Array if 64-bit values are needed.

Note: In a boolean context, a Vector3i will evaluate to false if it's equal to Vector3i(0, 0, 0). Otherwise, a Vector3i will always evaluate to true.

Constructs a Vector3i as a copy of the given Vector3i.

Vector3i Vector3i(from: Vector3)

Constructs a new Vector3i from the given Vector3 by truncating components' fractional parts (rounding towards zero). For a different behavior consider passing the result of Vector3.ceil(), Vector3.floor() or Vector3.round() to this constructor instead.

Returns a Vector3i with the given components.

Method Descriptions

Returns the distance between this vector and to.

float length() const 

Returns the length (magnitude) of this vector.

int length_squared() const 

Returns the squared length (squared magnitude) of this vector.

Returns the component-wise maximum of this and with, equivalent to Vector3i(maxi(x, with), maxi(y, with), maxi(z, with)).

Vector3i min(with: Vector3i) const

Vector3i sign() const 

Returns a new vector with each component set to 1 if it's positive, -1 if it's negative, and 0 if it's zero. The result is identical to calling @GlobalScope.sign() on each component.

Returns true if the vectors are not equal.

Vector3i operator %(right: Vector3i) 

Gets the remainder of each component of the Vector3i with the components of the given Vector3i. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using @GlobalScope.posmod() instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

print(Vector3i(10, -20, 30) % Vector3i(7, 8, 9)) # Prints (3, -4, 3)
Vector3i operator %(right: int) 

Gets the remainder of each component of the Vector3i with the given int. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using @GlobalScope.posmod() instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

print(Vector3i(10, -20, 30) % 7) # Prints (3, -6, 2)
Vector3i operator *(right: Vector3i) 

Multiplies each component of the Vector3i by the components of the given Vector3i.

Divides each component of the Vector3i by the given int.

bool operator <(right: Vector3i) 

Compares two Vector3i vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than the X value of the right vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, and then with the Z values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

bool operator <=(right: Vector3i) 

Compares two Vector3i vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than or equal to the X value of the right vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, and then with the Z values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

bool operator ==(right: Vector3i) 

Returns true if the vectors are equal.

bool operator >(right: Vector3i) 

Compares two Vector3i vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than the X value of the right vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, and then with the Z values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

bool operator >=(right: Vector3i) 

Compares two Vector3i vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than or equal to the X value of the right vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, and then with the Z values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

Vector3i operator unary+() 

Returns the same value as if the + was not there. Unary + does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

Vector3i operator unary-() 

Returns the negative value of the Vector3i. This is the same as writing Vector3i(-v.x, -v.y, -v.z). This operation flips the direction of the vector while keeping the same magnitude.
