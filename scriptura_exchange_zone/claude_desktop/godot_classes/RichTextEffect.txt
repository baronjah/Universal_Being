RichTextEffect
Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

A custom effect for a RichTextLabel.

Description
A custom effect for a RichTextLabel, which can be loaded in the RichTextLabel inspector or using RichTextLabel.install_effect().

Note: For a RichTextEffect to be usable, a BBCode tag must be defined as a member variable called bbcode in the script.

GDScriptC#
# The RichTextEffect will be usable like this: `[example]Some text[/example]`
var bbcode = "example"
Note: As soon as a RichTextLabel contains at least one RichTextEffect, it will continuously process the effect unless the project is paused. This may impact battery life negatively.
