EditorScenePostImport
Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Post-processes scenes after import.

Description
Imported scenes can be automatically modified right after import by setting their Custom Script Import property to a tool script that inherits from this class.

The _post_import() callback receives the imported scene's root node and returns the modified version of the scene:

GDScriptC#
@tool # Needed so it runs in editor.
extends EditorScenePostImport

# This sample changes all node names.
# Called right after the scene is imported and gets the root node.
func _post_import(scene):
	# Change all node names to "modified_[oldnodename]"
	iterate(scene)
	return scene # Remember to return the imported scene

func iterate(node):
	if node != null:
		node.name = "modified_" + node.name
		for child in node.get_children():
			iterate(child)
