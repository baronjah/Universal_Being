EditorScript
Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Base script that can be used to add extension functions to the editor.

Description
Scripts extending this class and implementing its _run() method can be executed from the Script Editor's File > Run menu option (or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + X) while the editor is running. This is useful for adding custom in-editor functionality to Godot. For more complex additions, consider using EditorPlugins instead.

Note: Extending scripts need to have tool mode enabled.

Example: Running the following script prints "Hello from the Godot Editor!":

GDScriptC#
@tool
extends EditorScript

func _run():
	print("Hello from the Godot Editor!")
Note: The script is run in the Editor context, which means the output is visible in the console window started with the Editor (stdout) instead of the usual Godot Output dock.

Note: EditorScript is RefCounted, meaning it is destroyed when nothing references it. This can cause errors during asynchronous operations if there are no references to the script.

Method Descriptions
void _run() virtual 

This method is executed by the Editor when File > Run is used.

void add_root_node(node: Node) 

Makes node root of the currently opened scene. Only works if the scene is empty. If the node is a scene instance, an inheriting scene will be created.

EditorInterface get_editor_interface() const 

Deprecated: EditorInterface is a global singleton and can be accessed directly by its name.

Returns the EditorInterface singleton instance.

Node get_scene() const 

Returns the edited (current) scene's root Node. Equivalent of EditorInterface.get_edited_scene_root().
