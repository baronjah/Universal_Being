Vector4i
A 4D vector using integer coordinates.

Description
A 4-element structure that can be used to represent 4D grid coordinates or any other quadruplet of integers.

It uses integer coordinates and is therefore preferable to Vector4 when exact precision is required. Note that the values are limited to 32 bits, and unlike Vector4 this cannot be configured with an engine build option. Use int or PackedInt64Array if 64-bit values are needed.

Note: In a boolean context, a Vector4i will evaluate to false if it's equal to Vector4i(0, 0, 0, 0). Otherwise, a Vector4i will always evaluate to true.

Constructs a Vector4i as a copy of the given Vector4i.

Vector4i Vector4i(from: Vector4)

Returns a Vector4i with the given components.

Method Descriptions

Returns the distance between this vector and to.

float length() const 

Returns the length (magnitude) of this vector.

int length_squared() const

Vector4i snapped(step: Vector4i) const 

Returns a new vector with each component snapped to the closest multiple of the corresponding component in step.

Vector4i snappedi(step: int) const

Vector4i operator %(right: Vector4i) 

Gets the remainder of each component of the Vector4i with the components of the given Vector4i. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using @GlobalScope.posmod() instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

print(Vector4i(10, -20, 30, -40) % Vector4i(7, 8, 9, 10)) # Prints (3, -4, 3, 0)

Gets the remainder of each component of the Vector4i with the given int. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using @GlobalScope.posmod() instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

print(Vector4i(10, -20, 30, -40) % 7) # Prints (3, -6, 2, -5)

bool operator <(right: Vector4i) 

Compares two Vector4i vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than the X value of the right vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

bool operator <=(right: Vector4i) 

Compares two Vector4i vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than or equal to the X value of the right vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

bool operator ==(right: Vector4i) 

Returns true if the vectors are exactly equal.

bool operator >(right: Vector4i) 

Compares two Vector4i vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than the X value of the right vector.

This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

bool operator >=(right: Vector4i) 

Compares two Vector4i vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than or equal to the X value of the right vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

Access vector components using their index. v[0] is equivalent to v.x, v[1] is equivalent to v.y, v[2] is equivalent to v.z, and v[3] is equivalent to v.w.

Vector4i operator unary+() 

Returns the same value as if the + was not there. Unary + does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

Vector4i operator unary-() 

Returns the negative value of the Vector4i. This is the same as writing Vector4i(-v.x, -v.y, -v.z, -v.w). This operation flips the direction of the vector while keeping the same magnitude.
