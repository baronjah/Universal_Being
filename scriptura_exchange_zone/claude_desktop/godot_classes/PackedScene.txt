PackedScene
Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

An abstraction of a serialized scene.

Description
A simplified interface to a scene file. Provides access to operations and checks that can be performed on the scene resource itself.

Can be used to save a node to a file. When saving, the node as well as all the nodes it owns get saved (see Node.owner property).

Note: The node doesn't need to own itself.

Example: Load a saved scene:

GDScriptC#
# Use load() instead of preload() if the path isn't known at compile-time.
var scene = preload("res://scene.tscn").instantiate()
# Add the node as a child of the node the script is attached to.
add_child(scene)
Example: Save a node with different owners. The following example creates 3 objects: Node2D (node), RigidBody2D (body) and CollisionObject2D (collision). collision is a child of body which is a child of node. Only body is owned by node and pack() will therefore only save those two nodes, but not collision.

GDScriptC#
# Create the objects.
var node = Node2D.new()
var body = RigidBody2D.new()
var collision = CollisionShape2D.new()

# Create the object hierarchy.
body.add_child(collision)
node.add_child(body)

# Change owner of `body`, but not of `collision`.
body.owner = node
var scene = PackedScene.new()

# Only `node` and `body` are now packed.
var result = scene.pack(node)
if result == OK:
	var error = ResourceSaver.save(scene, "res://path/name.tscn")  # Or "user://..."
	if error != OK:
		push_error("An error occurred while saving the scene to disk.")

Enumerations
enum GenEditState: 

GenEditState GEN_EDIT_STATE_DISABLED = 0

If passed to instantiate(), blocks edits to the scene state.

GenEditState GEN_EDIT_STATE_INSTANCE = 1

If passed to instantiate(), provides local scene resources to the local scene.

Note: Only available in editor builds.

GenEditState GEN_EDIT_STATE_MAIN = 2

If passed to instantiate(), provides local scene resources to the local scene. Only the main scene should receive the main edit state.

Note: Only available in editor builds.

GenEditState GEN_EDIT_STATE_MAIN_INHERITED = 3

It's similar to GEN_EDIT_STATE_MAIN, but for the case where the scene is being instantiated to be the base of another one.

Note: Only available in editor builds.

Method Descriptions
bool can_instantiate() const 

Returns true if the scene file has nodes.

SceneState get_state() const 

Returns the SceneState representing the scene file contents.

Node instantiate(edit_state: GenEditState = 0) const 

Instantiates the scene's node hierarchy. Triggers child scene instantiation(s). Triggers a Node.NOTIFICATION_SCENE_INSTANTIATED notification on the root node.

Error pack(path: Node) 

Packs the path node, and all owned sub-nodes, into this PackedScene. Any existing data will be cleared. See Node.owner.
