the script res://scripts/core/debug_3d_screen.gd

these lines 

func scale_selected_object(scale_factor: Vector3) -> void:
	if selected_object:
		selected_object.global_scale *= scale_factor
		print("Scaled " + selected_object.name + " to " + str(selected_object.global_scale))

func set_selected_object_scale(new_scale: Vector3) -> bool:
	if selected_object:
		selected_object.global_scale = new_scale
		print("Scaled " + selected_object.name + " to " + str(selected_object.global_scale))
		return true
	return false


maybe we want to change an node? when i used multi threading i made tasks to move it around, scale, rotate, even to use function get_node() i gad to do so, check the main.gd of the eden project, menu_keyboard we talked in the morning, here you can check the dimensional magics and turns systems of what i done and how if you wanna


Line 357:Cannot assign a new value to a constant.
Line 362:Cannot assign a new value to a constant.



the next script 

res://scripts/autoload/console_manager.gd

after line 88


	"todos": _cmd_multi_todos,
	"balance": _cmd_balance_workload#,#here we need to repair it
	#"calibrate": _cmd_terminal_calibration # Line 89:Identifier "_cmd_terminal_calibration" not declared in the current scope.

}

i commented out something that didnt work


also some connected script need some work 

Parser Error: Failed to compile depended scripts.


after that project load

can whip out console with tab

can put in help and i wanted to copy paste the text, but couldnt touch first few lines and last few too, its about viewport maybe?

tried to use command create tree

but got send to that script 

res://scripts/core/standardized_objects.gd

at line 234

cylinder.radius = def["size"].x / 2.0


,
rock appeared,but hower on skies

box appears and falls

ball appears and falls down and bounces 

ramp like rock hover over scene

sun appears nd is on the same starting height and stays there, even makes light

astral beings appeared i think, i see some white like rain in skies

pathway and bush appears but hover on skies

oh its the tree problem again

it kinda loaded ow but witg no trees, maybe we must move trees around so from my perspective they are more on the sides and further back, where my bottom and centers shall be what we call center of the scene, i am looking at, unless we make movable camera of some kinda, as you remember he idea was to showcase each part of the game, in tutorial, first load scene, which i will be debuging and telling you what i see, also we wanted to add the console logs, into files, with dates of run, so you can check newests of my tests, and we can start to debug it even better
