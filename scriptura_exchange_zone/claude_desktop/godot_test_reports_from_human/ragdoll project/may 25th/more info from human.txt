#this is the folder where editor logs console, 
#one i clicked each commands was about 500 kb, 
#tried cutting the repeatings, 
#mostly i seen three types of commands repeating, ragdoll talking, the cleaning memory 
#and later some testing for automation? some hotspots? and reaching token limits, it was fast way to start spamming console

# the console background needs to be transparental so we can see what is behind console too, and maintain balance of seeing text over it, similar to how windows made it

# ragdoll all commands needs an summary, where is every bit and byte, connected to ragdol and what and when he is supposed to do what

# for that we have that project with just 7 models to make bottom parts of humanoid, just bipedal bottom

#its in this folder, we checked it yesterday, and done already some research and understanding, we might need to find files in all our strongholds of data
