# 🆕 New Features Guide - Garden of Eden Creation Tool

## ✨ Features Added

### 1. 🌞 **Fixed Sun Spawning**
- Sun now spawns at **Y=15** (high in the sky)
- **No gravity** - stays in place
- Emits directional light properly
- Command: `sun`

### 2. 🖱️ **Mouse Click Object Inspection**
- **Left Click** any object to inspect it
- **Right Click** to clear selection
- Shows comprehensive debug panel with:
  - Object name and type
  - Position, rotation, scale
  - Physics properties (mass, velocity, gravity)
  - Metadata and groups
  - Children and script info
  - **Real-time updates** while selected

### 3. 🎈 **Gravity Exception System**
Objects with type "light" or "light_entity" automatically:
- Have `gravity_scale = 0.0`
- Are frozen in place
- Examples: sun, astral beings

### 4. 📊 **Enhanced Debug Panel**
Beautiful dark panel showing:
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### Testing the Sun:
```bash
# Run these commands
setup_systems    # If not already done
sun              # Creates sun at Y=15
# Click on the sun to see its properties!
```

### Testing Mouse Interaction:
1. Create some objects:
   ```bash
   tree
   box
   rock
   ```

2. **Left click** on any object to inspect
3. Watch the debug panel update in real-time
4. **Right click** to hide the panel

### Testing Gravity Exceptions:
```bash
sun              # No gravity, stays at Y=15
astral_being     # Also no gravity, floats
tree             # Has gravity, falls to ground
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Mouse Interaction System
- Uses `PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D` for accurate picking
- Checks all collision layers
- Finds root object even if clicking on child collider
- Updates 60 times per second when object selected

### Gravity System
Objects are categorized:
- **"static"** - No physics body
- **"dynamic"** - Normal gravity
- **"light"** - No gravity, frozen
- **"light_entity"** - No gravity, frozen

### Debug Panel Features
- **BBCode** formatted text
- Semi-transparent background
- Rounded corners
- Auto-sizing content
- Top-left position

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Mouse clicks not working?**
- Make sure objects have collision shapes
- Check if MouseInteractionSystem was created
- Run `setup_systems` if needed

**Sun still falling?**
- Check console for "Disabled gravity for: sun"
- Make sure you have the latest code
- Try spawning a new sun

**Debug panel not showing?**
- Left click on object (not empty space)
- Check console for "Selected: [object_name]"
- Make sure UI layer isn't hidden

## 🎯 Next Possible Enhancements

1. **Object Manipulation**
   - Drag objects with mouse
   - Rotate with mouse wheel
   - Scale with keyboard

2. **Advanced Debug**
   - Performance metrics
   - Signal connections
   - Animation state

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Highlight selected object
   - Show bounding box
   - Display physics shapes
