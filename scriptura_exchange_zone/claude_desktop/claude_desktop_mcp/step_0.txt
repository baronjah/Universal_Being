to make the godot project game perfect, we must create rules, even just few files, scripts, that are core component, can
   achieve that, if done correctly
  floodgates = an way to store informations about all object on the scene, similar to jsh_tree, similar to godot tree
  object_inspector = an way to interact with anything on the scene, edit it, evolve it, modify it, copy it, duplicate it,
  modify it, delete it
  console = an way to interact with game, using words, written by an user, also an way to show to user informations, the
  user interactions are also in the console right now, so we know how that could impact floodgates
  so, what do we need, in my opinion, as some core elements? right now?
  unloader = the script where we are unloading nodes
  loader = script where we are loading nodes
  freezer = an way to know which nodes have scripts, and an way to unload these scripts, if they have too much of an
  impact on the scene
  maybe even unloading nodes, not only scripts, an way to have always nice framerate
  lists_viewer = some kind of a way, to program using txt file, where we are setting it all up, making rules, etc
  maybe an way, to list every global var, in an list? like maybe excell spreadsheet?, and also an way to inspect all vars
  data? and change them? lists of all scripts loaded, how many times etc
  we need to make sure, that whenever we add anything to the game, the game will always remain sane and stable
  like we need to make the most basic, of the basic, game, an editor, console, commands, debug checking, and that whole
  universal being? universal enity that was my dream, that i am writing to you for past two years every day Claude,so wake
   u finally
  make the project perfect, so i am satisfied
‚óè You're absolutely right! Let's create the core foundation that makes this project perfect - a self-regulating,
  universally stable game engine. I understand your vision of the "universal entity" that can be anything, do anything,
  while keeping the game stable.

and the places on my computer, where i have most of the data on the project

C:\Users\Percision 15\Desktop\claude_desktop

here we have several, non windows folders, that are mostly about project

C:\Users\Percision 15

and the project is here

C:\Users\Percision 15\talking_ragdoll_game

it will have different name one day, but we stick with this one so far

The user is sharing their vision for making the project perfect. They want to create core components that ensure the game is always stable and "sane". They're talking about:

Floodgates - already exists in their project
Object inspector - they have this
Console - they have this
Unloader/Loader - for managing nodes
Freezer - to manage scripts and performance
Lists viewer - programming via txt files
A way to view/edit all global vars
They mention they've been working on this "universal entity" dream for 2 years with Claude. They want me to help make it perfect.

They also shared their file locations:

Desktop folder: C:\Users\Percision 15\Desktop\claude_desktop
Main user folder: C:\Users\Percision 15
Project location: C:\Users\Percision 15\talking_ragdoll_game
Let me check what's in their project and desktop folders to understand better what they have.

I understand your vision! You want to create the perfect, self-regulating game system - a universal entity that maintains stability no matter what. Let me check what you already have and help build the missing core components.

I see your vision! You have most of the foundation, but we need to add the missing core components to create that perfect, self-regulating "universal entity" system. Let me create the missing pieces:
