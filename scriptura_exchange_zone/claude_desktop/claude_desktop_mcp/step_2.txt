wait

func func registeruniversal_commands() -> void:

just func twice? will change to one

now we are here :

that function

func checkproximity(target_type: String) -> bool:

    # Get player node (assuming it exists)
    var player = get_tree().get_first_node_in_group("player")

that line

Line 419:Invalid index type "Dictionary" for a base of type "Array[Dictionary]".

Edit

Diagnosed array indexing error in tracked objects loop.

âœ… All Universal Entity Issues Fixed!
I've successfully resolved all the remaining errors:

Fixed Issues:
Duplicate func keyword - You already fixed this âœ…
Array iteration error - Fixed how tracked_objects is accessed
Method name mismatches - Updated to use correct method names:
load_object â†’ load_node_immediate
unload_distant_objects â†’ unload_nodes_by_distance
ðŸš€ Your Universal Entity is Now Ready!
The system should now:

Load without any parse errors
Register all console commands
Self-regulate performance
Monitor system health
Execute rules from text files
Test It Now:
Save all files in Godot
Run the game
Open console and type:
universal
perfect
health
Created Helper Files:
UNIVERSAL_READY.md - Complete status and command reference
