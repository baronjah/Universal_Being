Shader Usage in Godot 4.4: Procedural Textures & GPU-Based 3D Generation
Godot Shader Language (GDSL) in 4.4: Syntax and Capabilities (2D & 3D)
Godot 4.4 uses its own Godot Shader Language (GDSL) for most shading tasks. GDSL is based on GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) but is tightly integrated with Godot’s rendering pipeline
docs.godotengine.org
. A Godot shader file does not contain a main() function; instead, it declares a shader type and optional processing functions (like vertex, fragment, and light). Every shader must start by specifying its type on the first line (e.g. shader_type spatial;)
docs.godotengine.org
. The available shader types include spatial (for 3D materials), canvas_item (for 2D canvas items like sprites and UI), particles (for GPUParticles), sky (for sky backgrounds), and fog (for volumetric fog)
docs.godotengine.org
. This explicit type selection lets Godot know how to apply the shader (which render pipeline, built-in uniforms, etc., to use). Shader functions and workflow: In a spatial (3D) or canvas_item (2D) shader, you can define a vertex() function that runs for each vertex of the object and a fragment() function that runs for each pixel of the object’s surface
docs.godotengine.org
docs.godotengine.org
. The engine automatically handles common tasks (like transforming vertices to clip space and lighting calculations) unless you override them. For example:
The **vertex()** function can modify vertex positions or send custom varying data to the fragment stage. By default, Godot will transform vertices for you (applying model-view-projection), but you can override this by using certain render modes (e.g. render_mode unshaded, vertex_lighting if you want full control)
docs.godotengine.org
. In 2D, the vertex function can adjust positions for effects like wave distortion of a sprite.
The **fragment()** function computes the color or material properties of each pixel
docs.godotengine.org
. In 3D (spatial shaders), rather than directly outputting a color, you typically set material parameters like ALBEDO, ROUGHNESS, EMISSION, etc., which the engine’s lighting engine uses. (You can still directly set COLOR in 2D shaders or in unshaded modes.) For example, a spatial fragment shader might assign ALBEDO = texture(diffuse_map, UV).rgb; and adjust ROUGHNESS or other properties, whereas a 2D fragment shader might directly set COLOR = vec4(...) for a pixel color.
An optional **light()** function can be used in spatial shaders to customize per-light calculations
docs.godotengine.org
. In Godot 3.x (forward renderer) this was commonly used to define how each light adds to the fragment (running once per light). In Godot 4’s Forward+ renderer (clustered lighting), lighting for all lights is typically handled in a single pass automatically. The light() function is still available for advanced use (e.g. customizing light interaction or in the compatibility renderer), but many shaders won’t need to override it under Forward+.
GDSL capabilities: Godot’s shader language supports most common GLSL features (conditions, loops, functions, etc.) and provides built-in variables and uniforms specific to the engine. For example, in a spatial shader you have access to matrices like WORLD_MATRIX and INV_CAMERA_MATRIX, vertex info like VERTEX, NORMAL, and built-in varyings like UV, while in a canvas_item shader you have UV, SCREEN_UV, and can output to COLOR. Godot also provides time and screen resolution via built-ins (TIME, VIEWPORT_SIZE) and allows uniform arrays, texture samplers, etc. Like GLSL, you can define your own functions within the shader. GDSL also supports render modes to toggle engine features. For instance, a spatial shader can declare render_mode unshaded; to disable all lighting (making it purely emissive)
docs.godotengine.org
, or cull_disabled; to disable back-face culling, etc. In 4.4, Godot supports additional features like global uniforms (uniform values shared across all shaders in the project) and per-instance uniforms (unique to each material instance), which can be useful for managing procedural effects efficiently (e.g. giving each object a random tint without separate materials)
docs.godotengine.org
. Example – 2D procedural pattern: Below is a simple Godot canvas_item shader that generates a moving stripe pattern procedurally (no textures needed). It uses the built-in UV coordinate and a time uniform to animate a sine wave pattern across the X-axis:
glsl
Copy
Edit
shader_type canvas_item;
uniform float time;
void fragment() {
    float stripes = sin(UV.x * 20.0 + time);
    float intensity = stripes * 0.5 + 0.5; // normalize to 0-1
    COLOR = vec4(intensity, intensity, intensity, 1.0);
}
This shader will produce oscillating vertical stripes on a 2D canvas item (e.g. a Sprite’s material) as time increases. You would update the time uniform from GDScript each frame (see the GDScript integration section below) to animate the pattern. Example – 3D vertex manipulation: GDSL can also alter mesh shapes. For instance, you can create a wavy terrain by modifying vertex positions in the vertex() function. Suppose you have a plane mesh with UVs spanning 0-1. The following spatial shader displaces the mesh’s Y coordinate based on a simple sinusoidal function of its X,Z world position (creating a rippling wave or hill effect):
glsl
Copy
Edit
shader_type spatial;
uniform float amplitude = 2.0;
uniform float frequency = 1.0;
uniform float time;
void vertex() {
    // Simple wave using world XZ and time
    float wave = sin((WORLD_POSITION.x + WORLD_POSITION.z) * frequency + time);
    VERTEX.y += wave * amplitude;
}
This will make the plane mesh surface oscillate up and down like waves. You could replace the sine wave with a noise function or a heightmap texture sample for more complex terrain. In practice, for large-scale terrain or complex shapes, you might generate a heightmap or mesh data on the CPU or via a compute shader and then use a spatial shader to apply it (as discussed later).
GDSL vs GLSL: Differences, Interoperability, and When to Use Each
While GDSL’s syntax is very similar to GLSL, there are important differences due to engine integration. GDSL serves as a cross-platform layer that abstracts away whether the underlying renderer is OpenGL, Vulkan, or even Metal
forum.godotengine.org
. When you write a Godot shader, you don’t specify a GLSL version or worry about platform specifics – Godot will compile your shader to the appropriate GPU shader code (GLSL/GL3 for compatibility, SPIR-V for Vulkan, etc.) behind the scenes
forum.godotengine.org
. This means a Godot shader can run on any platform Godot supports without modification. By contrast, raw GLSL is tied to a specific graphics API and version (for example, a GLSL 330 shader for OpenGL or GLSL 450 for Vulkan). Key differences and interoperability considerations:
Structure: In GLSL you’d typically write a void main() for each shader stage and use specific inputs/outputs (e.g. gl_FragColor, gl_Position). In Godot, you do not write a main or use gl_FragColor; instead, you use the provided vertex, fragment, light functions and built-in variables (like VERTEX, COLOR, etc.) to interface with the engine’s pipeline. The engine internally generates the actual GLSL/SPIR-V entry points. For example, instead of setting gl_Position in a vertex shader, in Godot you assign to POSITION (or let the engine handle it unless using certain render modes)
docs.godotengine.org
.
Engine-provided variables: Many GLSL variables are replaced or unavailable in GDSL. For instance, rather than gl_FragCoord (pixel coordinates), Godot gives you SCREEN_UV or FRAGCOORD depending on context. Instead of manually managing varying variables (GLSL’s in/out between vertex and fragment), you use the varying keyword in Godot to declare interpolated data – Godot handles the rest. Attributes like vertex attributes (position, normal, UV) are accessed via built-ins (VERTEX, NORMAL, UV) or can be defined as attribute/varying if custom. Essentially, GDSL is a higher-level wrapper on GLSL with engine semantics.
No custom GLSL includes: You normally write shader code within Godot’s shader resource; you do not supply a .glsl file for regular materials. If you have an existing GLSL shader from outside (e.g. from Shadertoy or another engine), you must convert it into Godot’s format. Godot’s documentation provides a guide on how to migrate GLSL shaders into GDSL
docs.godotengine.org
. This involves mapping your GLSL code into the Godot shader structure: for example, code in GLSL’s main() might be split into Godot’s vertex() or fragment() functions, uniform declarations are mostly compatible (except arrays needing special handling via uniform array_name[size]), and certain GLSL built-ins (like gl_FragCoord, gl_PointCoord, etc.) have Godot equivalents or might not be exposed. The conversion guide also notes differences like coordinate systems, default precision, and so on
docs.godotengine.org
. When converting, you often remove version directives and any unsupported features. The end result is that in almost all cases you should use GDSL for in-engine materials, translating any external GLSL logic as needed into Godot's format.
When to use raw GLSL in Godot: Starting with Godot 4, the engine introduced the ability to use external GLSL shaders for specific purposes, notably compute shaders (described in the next section). These are not used as material shaders on meshes or 2D directly, but rather as GPU compute programs executed via script. In those cases, you actually write a .glsl file with GLSL code (with a special #[compute] tag) and load it at runtime. Other than compute, there is usually no need (and no straightforward support) to use raw GLSL files in Godot. If you require a very specialized shader stage not supported by GDSL (for example, a geometry shader or tessellation shader), currently Godot does not support those stages at all – neither via GDSL nor raw GLSL in the standard workflow. In such rare cases, you would have to modify the engine or use workarounds (or use compute shaders to achieve similar results). In summary, use GDSL for all standard 2D/3D shaders, and only drop down to GLSL for advanced compute or effects that GDSL cannot handle directly. The engine developers explicitly designed GDSL to cover most needs while ensuring cross-renderer compatibility
forum.godotengine.org
.
Intermixing GLSL and GDSL: There isn’t a direct way to embed raw GLSL snippets inside a Godot shader file (beyond the subset of GLSL that GDSL accepts). However, because GDSL is so close to GLSL, often you can copy-paste logic like noise functions or math routines from GLSL resources with minimal changes. Think of GDSL as essentially “GLSL with Godot-specific syntax and restrictions.” The advantage is that you don’t worry about writing #version directives or whether the shader runs on Vulkan vs OpenGL – Godot abstracts that. (For example, Godot will internally use Vulkan SL or SPIR-V on 4.x Forward+, but your shader code remains the same.) This abstraction is why one could say “Godot’s shader language is a single API over OpenGL, Vulkan, and Metal shaders”
forum.godotengine.org
 – you write one shader, and it works across different graphics backends.
GPU Compute Shaders in Godot 4.4: Offloading Work to the GPU
One of the exciting capabilities in Godot 4 is the support for compute shaders, which allow general-purpose computations on the GPU outside of the normal vertex/fragment pipeline. Godot’s compute shader support is exposed via the low-level RenderingDevice API. Unlike regular spatial or canvas shaders (which are written in GDSL and embedded in materials), a compute shader in Godot is written in GLSL and saved as a .glsl file in your project
docs.godotengine.org
. You include a special directive #[compute] at the top of the file to tell Godot it’s a compute shader, followed by a GLSL version (Godot uses #version 450 for Vulkan compatibility)
docs.godotengine.org
docs.godotengine.org
. For example, a minimal compute shader file might look like:
glsl
Copy
Edit
#[compute]
#version 450

layout(local_size_x = 2, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;

layout(set = 0, binding = 0, std430) buffer MyDataBuffer {
    float data[];
} my_data_buffer;

void main() {
    // Double each element in the array
    uint index = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
    my_data_buffer.data[index] *= 2.0;
}
In this example (from the official docs), the compute shader doubles each float in an input array
docs.godotengine.org
. The layout(local_size_x=..., local_size_y=..., local_size_z=...) in; line defines the workgroup size (here 2 threads in X dimension per workgroup), and the buffer MyDataBuffer { ... } is a Shader Storage Buffer Object (SSBO) binding that the CPU will provide. You’ll notice this is raw GLSL code; indeed “when you write compute shaders in Godot, you write them in GLSL directly”, since Godot does not have a separate high-level language for compute
docs.godotengine.org
. However, the syntax is still very much like regular GLSL and will feel familiar if you’ve written GDSL shaders (just without the shader_type and with compute-specific built-ins like gl_GlobalInvocationID)
docs.godotengine.org
. Using a compute shader in Godot: To use the above compute shader in your game, you don’t assign it to a material. Instead, you load and execute it via GDScript (or C#) through the RenderingDevice. The typical workflow is:
Enable a RenderingDevice context: Godot 4 uses a concept of a local RenderingDevice for running custom GPU tasks. You create one by calling RenderingServer.create_local_rendering_device() in GDScript
docs.godotengine.org
. (Alternatively, you can use the main rendering device via RenderingServer.get_rendering_device() if you want to synchronize with the frame rendering, which is useful if you need to use results immediately in the same frame. Using the main device ensures you can share textures/buffers with the scene easier
forum.godotengine.org
.)
Load and compile the compute shader: Load your .glsl file as an RDShaderFile resource and compile it to a RDShaderSPIRV. For example: var shader_file = load("res://compute_example.glsl"), then var shader_spirv = shader_file.get_spirv() and finally create a shader handle: var compute_shader = rd.shader_create_from_spirv(shader_spirv)
docs.godotengine.org
. This prepares the GPU program.
Prepare data buffers/textures: Allocate any buffers the shader needs. In the above example, we needed an array of floats, so we would create a PackedFloat32Array with our data and then create a storage buffer on the RenderingDevice: var buffer = rd.storage_buffer_create(size_in_bytes, data_bytes)
docs.godotengine.org
. For image/texture data, there are similar methods like texture_create on the RenderingDevice (or you can use existing ImageTexture resources by wrapping them via Texture2D.get_rd_texture()).
Bind buffers to the shader: Compute shaders use binding points (set and binding indices) to access resources. In GDSL materials this is abstracted via uniforms, but for compute you must explicitly bind. Godot’s API provides an rd.uniform_set_create(...) where you specify each resource binding. For instance, you’d create a Uniform struct, set its type to StorageBuffer, binding index to 0 (to match layout(binding = 0) in the shader) and add the buffer RID to it, then create a uniform set with the shader
docs.godotengine.org
. This uniform set acts like a "bag" of all buffers/textures the shader will use.
Dispatch the compute shader: Now you can execute the compute shader by calling something like rd.compute_dispatch(compute_shader, uniform_set, workgroup_count_x, workgroup_count_y, workgroup_count_z) which tells the GPU to run your compute shader with a certain number of workgroups. Continuing the example, if our data array had 10 elements and our local_size_x = 2, we might dispatch 5 workgroups (each of size 2) in x dimension to cover all 10 invocations. After dispatch, if you need the results back on CPU, you might call rd.buffer_get_data(buffer) or rd.sync() to ensure execution is complete and read from the buffer
docs.godotengine.org
. Otherwise, you can use the results on GPU directly (e.g. a texture written by the compute can be sampled by a material shader in the same frame if using the main RD and proper synchronization).
Free resources when done: Buffers, uniform sets, and even the local RenderingDevice (if you created one) consume GPU memory that isn’t automatically freed. You should free RIDs via RenderingServer.free_rid(rid) when they’re no longer needed
docs.godotengine.org
.
This is admittedly a low-level and advanced workflow – far more code than using a regular shader material. Compute shaders are powerful, but they require a good understanding of GPU programming. The Godot documentation warns that “here be dragons” for compute shaders and assumes you’re comfortable with how shaders work
docs.godotengine.org
. Notably, compute shaders only work with the Vulkan/Forward+ and Mobile renderers in Godot 4, not the OpenGL compatibility mode
docs.godotengine.org
forum.godotengine.org
. If a project is running in compatibility (OpenGL 3), you cannot use compute shaders at all. Workarounds without compute shaders: Before compute shaders were available (or if you choose not to use them), developers have used creative techniques to leverage the GPU for procedural generation:
Viewport “image” shaders: You can use a 2D quad with a ShaderMaterial as a stand-in compute step. For example, to generate a procedural texture, you might set up an off-screen Viewport with a Sprite that has a fragment shader drawing your pattern. By updating that viewport (or using ViewportTexture), you effectively render a procedural image. This image can then be used elsewhere (e.g. as a regular texture in other materials). Using multiple viewports or ping-ponging between textures allows iterative GPU processing each frame. This technique is often used for things like fluid simulations or Conway’s Game of Life, where a shader reads from a texture (the previous state) and draws a new texture (the next state) each frame. Godot 4’s SCREEN_TEXTURE and DEPTH_TEXTURE inputs allow shaders to sample the current or last frame buffer, which can be leveraged for certain post-process style feedback loops if needed.
Using fragment shaders for data: Although GDSL doesn’t let you write to arbitrary buffers, you can still encode data in colors. One approach is to render information to a texture using a shader (for instance, encode height values in a render target’s red channel). Then use get_texture().get_data() in GDScript to read those pixels back as an Image if CPU access is required. This is less efficient than compute (since reading back from GPU is slow), but can work for offline generation or infrequent updates. Godot 4.4’s introduction of Texture2D RD resources (like Texture2DStorage/Texture2DRD) simplifies using GPU textures as data containers – you can create a Texture2DRD via RenderingDevice, have a compute shader or a regular shader render into it, and then sample that texture in a regular material without ever copying to the CPU
godotengine.org
.
Particles as compute: Godot’s GPU particle shaders (shader_type particles) can manipulate particle properties each frame on the GPU. While meant for visual effects, creative developers sometimes abuse them to do parallel computations on many data points (since particles can move or change based on custom code each frame). This is a niche workaround but interesting to note as part of GPU-driven content – e.g. one could simulate flocking behavior or other compute tasks in a particle shader, then use particle positions as needed.
In general, if you need heavy procedural logic each frame (like physics simulations, fluid dynamics, complex noise generation) and you hit CPU limits, then using a compute shader or GPU-based method can massively speed it up by leveraging parallelism
godotengine.org
. For example, an official demo in Godot’s library generates a large 2048×2048 island heightmap from a noise function on the GPU via a compute shader – on a mid-range PC (RTX 3060), the GPU version outpaced the multi-threaded CPU noise generation once textures were above ~1024×1024 in size
godotengine.org
. This showcases that for high-resolution procedural data, GPU compute can be significantly faster. On smaller sizes or very simple tasks, the overhead of dispatching a compute job might outweigh benefits, so it’s important to choose the right tool (CPU vs GPU) for each situation
godotengine.org
.
Integration of Shaders with GDScript (CPU-GPU Interaction)
Shaders become truly powerful in a game when combined with logic from GDScript (or C#). You often want to feed data from the CPU (game logic) into the shader, or have the shader’s output affect gameplay. Here are common integration patterns:
Uniform Parameters: The primary way to send data to a shader (GDSL) is via uniforms. You declare uniform variables in the shader code (e.g. uniform float time; or uniform vec3 zone_color;). In GDScript, you can then set these uniforms on the shader material. For example, if you have a ShaderMaterial assigned to a Sprite or Mesh, you can do:
gdscript
Copy
Edit
$Sprite.material.set_shader_parameter("time", new_time_value)
This will update the time uniform in the shader (the first argument is the uniform name as a string, which must exactly match the name in the shader code)
docs.godotengine.org
. Setting shader params is efficient and can be done every frame. This is how you drive animations (e.g. passing an increasing time or an oscillating value), or respond to events (e.g. set a hit_position uniform when something impacts an object to cause a ripple at that point in the shader). You can also set uniform values in the editor (inspector) for static parameters, including textures (samplers). For instance, a shader might have uniform sampler2D noise_tex; which you assign a NoiseTexture resource to, or uniform vec4 team_color; that you set per material for team-based coloring. At runtime, these can still be adjusted via script as needed.
Signals and game events: Godot’s node system lets you connect events to code. Often, you might change a shader in response. For example, imagine a “terrain zone” that lights up when the player enters – you could connect the player’s area enter signal to a function that tween’s a glow_intensity uniform on the ground’s shader, making it gradually brighten. Another scenario: in a sandbox game, if the user “paints” on the world, your code could capture the paint position and pass it to the shader as an array of points or as a dynamically updated texture.
Using Textures as Data: Shaders can sample textures, which is a versatile way to feed complex data. You could generate an image in code (using Image class drawing or loading from disk) and then use an ImageTexture so the shader can access it. Conversely, you might render something with a shader to a ViewportTexture and then have GDScript read that back or use it elsewhere. A practical example: in a voxel sandbox, you might have a 2D texture representing a top-down map of where resources are. Your shader could use that to color the terrain differently in resource zones. If the game logic changes the resource map (e.g. resources get depleted), you could update the Image and reload it to the texture, and the shader will reflect the change.
CPU reading shader outputs: Generally, reading data back from a shader is trickier, as shaders run on the GPU asynchronously. However, you can use approaches like Texture.get_data() to pull an image that a shader drew (on a Viewport). With compute shaders, you have explicit methods to read buffers back. For instance, after running a compute job you could do var byte_data = rd.buffer_get_data(buffer_rid) to get the results into a ByteArray, or use RenderingServer.sync() to wait for GPU completion then use the data. Keep in mind that reading from GPU to CPU can stall performance, so it’s best done sparingly or asynchronously (Godot’s RenderingDevice has an async read for buffers to avoid stalling the main thread). Some designs avoid CPU reads altogether by keeping the data on the GPU – e.g. if you generate a heightmap via compute, you could sample that heightmap in a vertex shader for terrain, never needing to copy it to CPU.
Global and per-instance uniforms: Godot 4 introduced global shader uniforms which can be set once and seen by all shaders
docs.godotengine.org
. For example, a global wind direction or time value can be broadcast to every shader that uses it. You set these via RenderingServer.global_shader_parameter_set(name, value) at runtime
docs.godotengine.org
. This is convenient for global effects (like a day/night cycle affecting all materials). Per-instance uniforms allow each rendered instance of a mesh to have a unique uniform without duplicating the material. This is useful for things like giving each instance a different seed or color. Setting these up involves the instance_set_shader_param on the VisualInstance (3D) or CanvasItem (2D) with the material override. While not directly asked in the question, these features are worth noting as they are part of efficient data feeding into shaders in Godot 4.4.
Compute shader integration: As described, compute shaders are invoked via script, so integration is manual. But you can mix this with gameplay code. For example, you might use GDScript to decide when to run a compute shader (e.g. regenerate a texture when the player digs the terrain), or use the CPU to prepare some data for the GPU to use. A great example from the official demos is a GPU-based water ripple effect: the game code detects when and where raindrops fall or the player “draws” on water, and it updates a small buffer or texture that the compute shader uses as input to add disturbances. The compute shader then updates the water heightmap each frame. That heightmap is fed into a regular 3D material to actually offset vertices or normals for rendering the water surface
godotengine.org
godotengine.org
. In that demo, when the mouse is not interacting, the script randomly adds “drops” into a queue that the compute shader will process, and when the mouse is drawing, it continuously feeds positions of the drawing into the compute shader input
godotengine.org
. This kind of interplay shows that GDScript drives the high-level behavior (where/when drops occur), while the GPU does the heavy lifting of propagating ripples, and then the shader on the water mesh visualizes it. The result is a smooth interactive water surface powered by CPU-GPU collaboration.
Example – feeding a shader from code: Suppose you want to create a “heatmap” texture in a simulation game, where red areas are hot. You could maintain a CPU array of temperatures, but drawing that every frame on CPU is slow. Instead, you can have a small shader that plots points onto a texture. One approach: keep a ImageTexture for the heatmap, and when something heats up, use Image.set_pixel(x,y,color) on an Image and update the texture data (or use a Viewport and draw points via a shader). The shader that renders the terrain could sample this heatmap texture to adjust colors (e.g. blending in red where hot). This way, your GDScript only updates the data points, and the GPU handles the visualization each frame.
In summary, Godot provides multiple mechanisms to make shaders dynamic: you can change uniform values in real-time from code
docs.godotengine.org
, swap or update textures the shader uses, and even run entirely separate GPU compute passes driven by code. This allows for rich procedural content that reacts to gameplay. For example, in a sandbox game you might use a combination of techniques: a compute shader to generate a procedural terrain heightmap, a spatial shader to tessellate/displace a mesh with that heightmap, a fragment shader to apply procedural texturing (like blending snow/grass based on height and slope), and GDScript to spawn new compute jobs or shader updates when the player alters the world (digging, building, etc.). All of these pieces have to interplay correctly with careful sync, but Godot 4.4’s toolset is capable of it.
Practical Examples of Procedural Textures and 3D Procedural Environments
To ground these concepts, let’s look at how 2D and 3D shaders can create dynamic content in practice:
Procedural Textures (2D Shaders): With a canvas_item shader, you can create infinite varieties of patterns. Common examples include noise textures (Perlin/Simplex noise implemented in the fragment shader), checkerboards, gradients, and fractals. For instance, you could implement a 2D noise function in the fragment() and output it as COLOR to create a noisemap on the fly – useful for randomness (clouds, fire, terrain alpha masks). Another example: a procedural triplanar texture – instead of using a fixed texture for ground, you can have a fragment shader generate stripes for strata layers or procedural spots for gravel. These textures can be static or animated (by using TIME or an animated uniform). The advantage is memory savings (no need to import large textures, you generate what you need) and flexibility (players could customize pattern via parameters). Godot’s visual shader editor or written shaders can both handle this, and performance is often good for moderate resolutions. If the procedural texture needs to be used on many objects or as a resource, you might render it to an Image once via a viewport or compute shader and then reuse it rather than computing in every object’s shader.
Procedural 3D Surfaces (Spatial Shaders): In 3D, shaders commonly do vertex displacement to achieve procedural geometry shapes. For example, a rolling hills landscape can be done by displacing a high-poly plane’s Y coordinate using a mathematical function or a noise texture in the vertex shader (as shown in the earlier snippet). This creates the illusion of a unique terrain shape without altering the mesh in code. Another use is parallax mapping or relief mapping on surfaces to give depth (not actual new geometry, but shader tricks to simulate it). If actual geometry creation is needed (like digging a hole), typically that requires CPU mesh manipulation or a heightmap update, but the shader can smoothly interpolate or animate geometry in ways that would be expensive if done on CPU every frame.
Terrain Zones and Biomes: You can combine shader techniques to create varied “zones” on a terrain. For instance, a single terrain mesh could have a shader that checks the world position or a biome map texture to choose colors and features – green grass in one area, dry cracked soil in another, blending seamlessly. A procedural approach might involve using noises: e.g. use Perlin noise to generate a mask for grass vs dirt distribution in the fragment shader, so as the player walks, they see organically changing ground textures. This can be done by sampling at different scales and thresholds in the shader rather than painting a large texture. Additionally, vertex shaders could raise certain areas (like making bumps or dunes in a desert zone) based on another noise function. By animating the inputs or swapping the noise seed, you could even “morph” the terrain over time (imagine a corruption spreading, altering the ground appearance via shader logic).
3D “Notepad” or Drawing in 3D: A “3D notepad-like environment” suggests the idea of being able to draw or write dynamically in a 3D world. Shaders can achieve this by using textures as canvases. For example, you could have a plane in 3D that the player can draw on – internally, you maintain a texture that represents the ink. The player’s drawing input (perhaps using the mouse in a 3D projected coordinate) can be converted via GDScript into marks on an Image (or directly drawn by a compute shader or CanvasItem shader). The plane’s material then samples this texture to display what’s been drawn. This is akin to a decal or painting system. For true 3D “drawing in air” (like a magical trail in space or VR painting ala Tilt Brush), one might use particles or meshes, but shaders can give them a glowing, animated look or procedurally animate their fade-out. Another interpretation is a stylized rendering where the 3D world looks hand-drawn (notebook sketch style). This can be done with a combination of a special fragment shader (to quantize colors, draw outlines, hatch shading etc.) and maybe post-processing full-screen filters. Godot’s shaders are flexible enough to create cartoon, sketch, or painted art styles entirely through math – for example, using the dot product of normals and view direction to create cross-hatching patterns for shading.
Sandbox Games and Virtual Environments: Many sandbox games (think Minecraft, or sim games) use procedural generation. While the heavy lifting of generating terrain blocks or meshes is often done on the CPU, shaders enhance the visual variety. In Godot, you could use a shader to randomly shift the UV of a grass texture per instance to avoid tiling, or use a vertex shader to sway foliage in the wind (driven by a global wind uniform). A virtual environment can also incorporate procedural sky shaders – e.g. a shader_type sky that generates clouds and horizon gradient procedurally, instead of using a skybox texture. Godot 4.4 supports sky shaders which can be purely procedural or partly textured. GPU compute can also simulate things like erosion or water flow in a sandbox: you might periodically run a compute shader that modifies a heightmap or material mask based on physics rules, then have the visual shaders pick up those results to alter the appearance of the world (e.g. after rain, puddles appear via a dynamic wetness mask that gradually dries out, all handled by shaders).
Advanced example – volumetric or raymarched content: Although Godot doesn’t natively support geometry shaders, clever use of fragment shaders can render complex 3D scenes via raymarching (rendering an implicit 3D function). For instance, a compute shader or fragment shader can implement a raymarch for a signed distance field (SDF) to create an entire 3D fractal or cloud shape inside a single quad. This is an advanced technique often seen in demoscene and Shadertoy examples. In Godot, one could use a full-screen quad in a Viewport with such a shader to create a dynamic background or effect (like a procedurally generated 3D nebula or a “holodeck” environment that’s actually drawn by a shader). Performance depends on complexity, but it’s a way to get 3D content without any meshes at all. One community demo (by a Godot contributor) used compute shaders to generate volumetric clouds in real-time, where the compute produced a 3D texture or a series of 2D slices that a shader then rendered as fluffy clouds – demonstrating that even volumetric fog can be driven by procedural GPU code in Godot

Real-world references: The Godot documentation and official demos provide great examples of these concepts in action. The Compute Shader Heightmap demo shows how to generate a terrain heightmap using compute and compare it with CPU generation, including the performance numbers mentioned

. There are community projects and tutorials on using noise in shaders for things like fire, water, or camouflage patterns. Official docs on the shading language cover how to implement common shader features (UV scrolling, blur, etc.), and the Converting GLSL to Godot guide is handy if you find a cool GLSL snippet online and want to adapt it

. The Godot shader editor also has a live preview and shader toy, which is very helpful for iterating on procedural visuals. In conclusion, Godot 4.4’s shader system is a powerful tool for procedural content. GDSL gives you high-level control to write 2D and 3D shaders that can generate patterns and effects on the fly, from simple animated textures to complex terrain blending. When more compute power is needed, Godot now allows tapping into GLSL compute shaders to leverage the GPU for tasks like heightmap generation, fluid simulation, or other GPGPU algorithms – effectively treating the GPU as an extra processor for game logic or content creation

. The combination of GDScript (for game logic and data preparation) with shaders (for fast parallel computation and rendering) opens up a lot of possibilities: you can create rich sandbox worlds where large terrains are generated and textured procedurally, or virtual art tools where players can paint and see their strokes become 3D objects or effects in real time. By using the techniques above – uniforms, shader parameters, compute dispatch, and creative rendering tricks – developers can integrate procedural generation deeply into their Godot 4.4 projects, resulting in dynamic and responsive game environments.
