Interactive UI menus in a 3D world can be achieved in Godot 4.4+ by using flat 2D elements (like panels, buttons, icons) placed as Sprite3D or MeshInstance3D nodes in the 3D scene. This approach lets you give your UI depth and integrate it with the 3D world, while still maintaining a minimal flat design (clean gradients, rounded shapes, etc). Below, we compare texture-based vs shader-based techniques for flat UI, explain how to create rounded/gradient shapes with shaders, discuss making these 3D UI elements interactive (hover, click, animate), and cover efficient ways to handle dynamic UI states. Compatibility notes for Godot 3.x vs 4.x are also included.
Texture-Based vs. Shader-Based Flat UI Shapes
Texture-Based UI Elements: One straightforward way to put UI in 3D is to create the UI graphics as 2D textures (images) and apply them to Sprite3D or MeshInstance3D nodes. For example, you might design a button or icon with rounded corners and a gradient fill in an image editor or as a PNG asset. In Godot, you can then assign that texture to a Sprite3D (which displays it on a flat plane in 3D) or to a Quad Mesh (MeshInstance3D) with a material. This approach is simple: what you see in the image is exactly what appears in the game. It’s great for complex shapes or detailed icons that would be hard to generate with code. However, purely texture-based UI can be less flexible for changes: if you want to change a color or shape, you might need to swap to a different texture or generate one via a Viewport or Image code. You also need to import or preload multiple images for different states (hover, pressed, etc.), which can increase memory usage and require maintaining multiple assets. Shader-Based UI Elements: A more flexible approach is to use procedural shaders on simple geometry (like a plain rectangle mesh) to draw the UI shapes (colors, gradients, rounded borders) on the fly. Godot’s ShaderLanguage (for 3D, a Spatial shader in Godot 3.x or StandardMaterial3D/ShaderMaterial in Godot 4.x) can determine the color of each pixel of a quad based on math – for example, output a circle or rounded rectangle with a gradient fill, without needing any pre-made texture. The advantages are significant: you can easily tweak the shape radius, colors, or gradient parameters via script or editor without changing images. Shapes rendered by shader can scale to any resolution with crisp edges (especially if using analytic distance functions or high-res buffers), fitting well with a minimal flat style. The downside is the upfront complexity – you’ll need to write shader code (or use Visual Shaders) to produce the desired shapes. Complex iconography (like intricate icons) might be impractical to generate purely with code, so in those cases you might still use textures or Signed Distance Field (SDF) textures for scalable icons. In summary, for simple geometric UI elements (rounded buttons, panels, rings, etc.), shader-based rendering offers dynamic styling (easy recoloring, smooth animation of shape properties) and potentially fewer assets to manage. Performance Considerations: Both methods can be efficient if used well. A small shader on a quad has negligible cost, even if you have many, since the fill area is small (just the pixels of the quad) – though very complex fragment shader logic on many elements could affect the fill rate on low-end hardware
docs.godotengine.org
. Textures have a one-time memory cost but sampling them is cheap. If you need a lot of variation (many differently colored or shaped buttons), using one flexible shader with per-instance parameters (discussed later) can be more efficient than having dozens of separate texture files. In Godot 4, you can even mix approaches: for example, use a simple base texture (like a white rounded rectangle) and then tint it with a shader or modulate color, or overlay a procedurally generated highlight.
Note: Godot 4’s built-in materials (e.g. StandardMaterial3D) support an unshaded mode for 2D-style rendering in 3D. Ensure you set the material to unshaded (or use a ShaderMaterial with render_mode unshaded) for UI planes, so they won’t be affected by 3D lighting/shadows – this keeps your flat UI colors consistent and vibrant. Sprite3D’s default material is unshaded, making it ideal for UI elements (it simply displays the texture as-is)
docs.godotengine.org
docs.godotengine.org
.
Creating Rounded and Gradient-Filled Shapes with Shaders
One of the key challenges in a minimal flat UI is drawing rounded shapes (e.g. buttons with rounded corners or circular icons) and smooth gradients without pixelation. Godot offers multiple ways to achieve this:
Using Gradient Textures: Godot has a built-in Gradient resource and GradientTexture2D class, which can procedurally generate a texture of a gradient. In the editor, you can define a Gradient (color points and interpolation) and then create a GradientTexture2D from it. This texture can be applied to a Sprite3D or as a material’s albedo on a Mesh. The GradientTexture can be configured to fill in different modes – linear (across the texture), radial, or even square pattern
docs.godotengine.org
. For example, a linear gradient from top to bottom can be achieved by setting the GradientTexture’s fill mode to linear (FILL_LINEAR) and adjusting fill_from and fill_to (e.g. (0,0) to (0,1) for vertical)
docs.godotengine.org
docs.godotengine.org
. A radial gradient can be created by switching to FILL_RADIAL, which will interpret the gradient colors in a circular fashion
docs.godotengine.org
. Because these GradientTextures are generated by Godot, they are resolution-independent (you can choose the texture size) and can be updated at runtime by code if needed (for instance, moving the fill_to offset or changing colors via the Gradient resource). The documentation notes that “This texture is able to transform a color transition into different patterns such as a linear or a radial gradient”
docs.godotengine.org
, which is exactly what we need for UI backgrounds.
Writing a Custom Shader (Godot Shader Language): For ultimate flexibility, you can write a shader that computes colors for your UI element’s surface. In a Spatial (3D) shader, each fragment has UV coordinates that you can use to decide its color. To illustrate, here’s a simple example of a vertical gradient shader for a Sprite3D or Quad mesh:
glsl
Copy
Edit
// Example: Unshaded shader for a vertical gradient rectangle
shader_type spatial;
render_mode unshaded;                   // Do not use 3D lighting
uniform vec4 color_top : hint_color;    // top color of the gradient
uniform vec4 color_bottom : hint_color; // bottom color of the gradient

void fragment() {
    float t = UV.y;                     // UV.y goes from 0 at bottom to 1 at top
    vec4 color = mix(color_bottom, color_top, t);
    ALBEDO = color.rgb;
    ALPHA = color.a;
}
This shader blends between color_bottom and color_top vertically. By adjusting those uniform colors via the Inspector or code, you recolor the gradient easily. You can similarly create horizontal or diagonal gradients (using UV.x or combinations), or radial gradients (using the distance of UV from center). For example, a radial gradient could set float r = length(UV - vec2(0.5)); and use r to mix colors (perhaps with a smoothstep for a soft edge). Rounded Corners and Shapes: To draw a rounded rectangle (or circle) with a shader, you can use a math-based mask. One common technique is to use a signed distance function (SDF) or simple coordinate checks to determine if a pixel is inside the shape. For a rectangle with corner radius, you can calculate the distance of the fragment UV to the rectangle’s inner region and fade out pixels beyond the radius. For instance, consider the UV space [0,1] of a quad: you want to set alpha=0 outside a rounded rect. A snippet approach:
glsl
Copy
Edit
uniform float corner_radius : hint_range(0.0, 0.5) = 0.1; // in UV proportion (0.5 = half width)
void fragment(){
    // Compute how far this UV is from the rect bounds minus the corner radius:
    float r = corner_radius;
    vec2 rect_inset = vec2(r, r);
    // Distance from edges (negative if inside the inner rect area, positive if outside):
    vec2 dist;
    dist.x = (UV.x < r) ? r - UV.x : (UV.x > 1.0 - r ? UV.x - (1.0 - r) : 0.0);
    dist.y = (UV.y < r) ? r - UV.y : (UV.y > 1.0 - r ? UV.y - (1.0 - r) : 0.0);
    float corner_dist = length(dist);  // distance from the nearest corner center
    if (corner_dist > r) {
        ALPHA = 0.0;                   // outside rounded corner
    } else {
        // Inside shape: output gradient color (as above)
        float t = UV.y;
        vec3 col = mix(color_bottom.rgb, color_top.rgb, t);
        ALBEDO = col;
        ALPHA = 1.0;
    }
}
The above logic (pseudo-code style) zeroes out ALPHA for pixels in the corners beyond the radius. What remains is a rectangle with smooth rounded corners. We could improve it with smoothing on the edge (using smoothstep with the fragment’s screen derivative fwidth to anti-alias), but even as-is it produces a clean result. This approach is similar to community shaders that add corner radius to textures
godotshaders.com
godotshaders.com
. In fact, one Godot community shader uses a 0–1 normalized corner_scale to adjust from sharp rectangle to full ellipse
godotshaders.com
, and it simply discards pixels where (UV.x, UV.y) is outside the rounded corner equations
godotshaders.com
godotshaders.com
. Tip: You can combine shape masks with gradients easily – as shown, just compute the gradient color for inside-shape fragments. By changing uniforms like corner_radius or the gradient colors in GDScript, you can animate the button’s look (e.g. on focus, increase the corner radius for a pill effect, or change the gradient).
Shader with Texture vs Pure Shader: If writing complex shape logic seems daunting, a hybrid approach is to use a simple texture mask and a shader to recolor or add effects. For example, use a white image of a circle or rounded rectangle (possibly an SDF texture) and then in a shader simply sample it and use it as alpha (cutoff) and multiply by a uniform color or gradient. This way the heavy lifting of shape outline is done by a texture (which can be resolution-independent if using SDF), and you still get flexibility in coloring via shader. Godot’s CanvasItem shaders (for 2D) and Spatial shaders (3D) both allow using texture samplers (texture() in shader code) to combine with procedural color. This is essentially how Godot’s StyleBoxTexture works in 2D UI: one could import a 9-patch with rounded corners and assign a gradient modulate. But since we are in 3D, we manage it ourselves on a material.
Godot Shader vs GLSL: Note that Godot’s shader language is very close to GLSL. You don’t typically write raw GLSL for materials; instead you use shader_type spatial; (or canvas_item for 2D/CanvasItem shaders) and Godot’s shader compiler handles it (under the hood it’s translated to SPIR-V for Vulkan in Godot 4). So you can leverage any GLSL knowledge – vector operations, mix, smoothstep, etc. – directly in Godot shaders. The above examples use that syntax. In Godot 4, you can even develop these in the Visual Shader editor if you prefer node-based shader graphs (Godot 4.1 introduced a GradientTexture node to easily sample a Gradient resource in visual shaders
m.youtube.com
). For brevity, writing the shader in code as above is often clearer.
Interactivity in 3D UI Elements (Hover, Click, Signals)
Making your 3D UI respond to user input involves picking the 3D object under the mouse and triggering actions. Unlike traditional 2D UI (Control nodes) which handle this automatically, 3D objects need a bit of setup: 1. Enable Input Pickable Collisions: To have a Sprite3D or MeshInstance3D react to clicks, you should give it a collision shape and enable it to receive raycast picks. The usual pattern is to add an Area3D or StaticBody3D as a parent/child of the visual element, with a CollisionShape3D that matches the UI element’s geometry (e.g. a thin box or sphere covering the plane). In the CollisionObject’s properties, set input_ray_pickable = true – this allows the engine to consider it for raycasting and send input events to it
docs.godotengine.org
docs.godotengine.org
. (In Godot 3.x this was called input_pickable, now it’s specifically ray_pickable for 3D.) Also ensure the collision layer/mask of the UI collider is such that the camera’s picking ray will hit it (usually default layer works unless you have custom masks). 2. Using CollisionObject Signals: Godot 3D collisions support signals for mouse input. CollisionObject3D (the base for Area3D, StaticBody3D, etc.) provides an input_event signal that fires whenever an unhandled input event hits the collider, as well as mouse_entered and mouse_exited signals for hover events
docs.godotengine.org
docs.godotengine.org
. This is very convenient: you can connect these signals in the editor or via code. For example, if you have an Area3D node for a button, you can connect its mouse_entered to a function that highlights the button (e.g. change its shader uniform to a hover color), and mouse_exited to un-highlight. The input_event signal provides details like which camera saw the event, the exact InputEvent (so you can check if it was a left mouse click, etc.), and even the hit position on the object
docs.godotengine.org
. A basic use in GDScript might look like:
gdscript
Copy
Edit
# Assume area3d is the Area3D node with a collision shape
area3d.connect("mouse_entered", self, "_on_button_mouse_enter")
area3d.connect("mouse_exited", self, "_on_button_mouse_exit")
area3d.connect("input_event", self, "_on_button_input")
And the handlers:
gdscript
Copy
Edit
func _on_button_mouse_enter():
    $Sprite3D.material.set_shader_parameter("hovered", true)
    # Or use an AnimationPlayer to scale up slightly

func _on_button_mouse_exit():
    $Sprite3D.material.set_shader_parameter("hovered", false)

func _on_button_input(camera, event, click_position, click_normal, shape_idx):
    if event is InputEventMouseButton and event.button_index == MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT:
        if event.pressed:
            _activate_button()  # your custom function for click action
In this pseudo-code, we assume the Sprite3D has a ShaderMaterial with a uniform (e.g. hovered) that tints the color or something. We check for left-button pressed to register a click. The click_position provided is the 3D world position on the UI surface where the click hit – which you might use if you need to map the click within the button (for example, for a slider or more complex control, you could translate that to a percentage). Using these signals and properties, Godot can handle multiple UI elements naturally. If two UI elements overlap in 3D, only the front-most (closest to camera) will pick the ray by default. You can configure collision priority by adjusting collision layers or using the RayCast3D method below if needed (the engine’s default is that nearer objects capture the event, as expected). The mouse_entered/exited signals also won’t fire if an object is occluded by another pickable object in front of it
docs.godotengine.org
. 3. Manual Raycasting (alternative): In some cases, you may prefer to manually handle picking – for example, if you want a central manager to determine which UI element is under the cursor each frame (to change cursor shape, etc.). You can do this with a RayCast3D node or the physics direct space state. Godot’s camera provides methods to project a screen point into the 3D world. For instance, in Godot 4:
gdscript
Copy
Edit
func _physics_process(delta):
    var camera = $Camera3D
    var mouse_pos = get_viewport().get_mouse_position()
    var ray_origin = camera.project_ray_origin(mouse_pos)
    var ray_dir   = camera.project_ray_normal(mouse_pos)
    var ray_length = 1000.0
    var space_state = get_world_3d().direct_space_state
    var result = space_state.intersect_ray(
        PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D.create(ray_origin, ray_origin + ray_dir * ray_length)
    )
    if result:
        print("Hit object: ", result.collider.name)
This uses Camera3D.project_ray_origin() and project_ray_normal() to get a ray from the camera through the mouse position, then DirectSpaceState.intersect_ray() to find what it hits
docs.godotengine.org
docs.godotengine.org
. You can filter the ray by setting query.collide_with_areas = true (to hit Areas) or using collision layers/masks. If result.collider matches one of your UI nodes (or its parent), you know that UI element is hovered. You could then call methods on it (e.g., highlight) and on click events (from _input(event) in the script) perform a similar raycast to decide which button was clicked. This is essentially what the engine does internally for the input_event signals, but doing it yourself can give more control (e.g., implementing drag-and-drop, or allowing clicking “through” transparent parts of a shape by checking the UV hit point – though Godot’s collision by default doesn’t know about a Sprite’s transparency, it treats the whole shape as hit). 4. Hover Feedback and Animation: With either approach, you’ll want to give the user visual feedback. A common technique in flat design is to slightly change the color or opacity on hover, and perhaps scale or raise the element. Using a shader uniform (as in the example above) is effective – the GDScript simply sets a boolean or a color, and the shader can lerp to a lighter color or outline. Alternatively, you can swap to a different material or texture on hover (texture-based approach: e.g., use a brighter sprite). If you prefer not to use a shader for this, you can also just call $Sprite3D.modulate = Color(1.2, 1.2, 1.2) in Godot 4 (note: in Godot 4, Sprite3D inherits Node3D, which doesn’t have modulate like a CanvasItem, but you can simulate it by changing the material or using an Emission color on a StandardMaterial3D). Another approach: use an AnimationPlayer on the UI element. For example, create an animation for hover enter that scales the node up 1.1× and another for exit that scales back down, and play those on the respective signals. Animations can also handle “pressed” state (e.g. briefly shrink on click). Godot 4’s animation system can animate material properties directly if set up in the editor (or you can animate a ShaderMaterial’s param via code). 5. Click Actions: For clicking, if you connected input_event, you might directly call a function when the left button is pressed. If using manual raycast, you’d handle it in _unhandled_input(event) by doing a raycast when a click is detected. One thing to consider is UI focus and multiple clicks: If your 3D UI is part of a larger interactive scene, you might want to stop other interactions when the UI is clicked. Godot will mark the InputEvent as handled if a CollisionObject input_event signal does not call event.ignore(). By default, if you connect the signal, once it’s handled by your function, other 3D nodes shouldn’t also receive it. But you can manage this explicitly by setting Input.set_mouse_mode() or using groups/tags to disable character movement, etc., when UI is active (similar to how you’d handle a modal menu in 2D). Example: Suppose we have a MeshInstance3D for a menu button (a Quad mesh), with a child Area3D+CollisionShape the same size. We give it a ShaderMaterial that has a uniform pressed_color and normal_color. We can toggle those on click:
gdscript
Copy
Edit
func _on_button_input(camera, event, click_position, click_normal, shape_idx):
    if event is InputEventMouseButton and event.button_index == MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT and event.pressed:
        $MeshInstance3D.material.set("shader_parameter/color_top", pressed_color)
        # ... perform action, then maybe reset color after some time:
        await get_tree().create_timer(0.1).timeout
        $MeshInstance3D.material.set("shader_parameter/color_top", normal_color)
This snippet would flash the button’s top color when clicked. Alternatively, use an AnimationPlayer to animate the color or scale for a nicer effect. Godot’s official demos include a “GUI in 3D” example which uses a sub-viewport (Texture) for UI and demonstrates forwarding input
forum.godotengine.org
. However, since we are focusing on Sprite3D/MeshInstance3D, our approach differs by implementing the interactions manually or via collisions. The key takeaway is that Godot 4.x provides built-in support for 3D input picking – you just need to enable it and connect the signals, very much like connecting a Button’s pressed signal in 2D, except using an Area3D in 3D space.
Dynamic UI with Shader Parameters and Material Overrides
For UI menus that change at runtime – e.g. icons swapping, colors changing to indicate state, enabling/disabling buttons – you should leverage Godot’s material and shader flexibility to avoid having to duplicate scenes or use multiple textures for every variation. Swapping Icons/Textures: If your UI element is simply displaying an icon (say a Sprite3D for a weapon icon in an inventory), you can change its texture via code: sprite3d.texture = preload("res://new_icon.png") for example. This is straightforward. If using a MeshInstance3D with a material, you might swap the material or set a different albedo texture (mesh_instance.material.set_texture("albedo_texture", new_texture)). For a more parametric icon (say a shape drawn by shader), you might switch a uniform that selects the shape or toggle to a different shader. One advanced trick is to pack multiple shape masks into one atlas texture or shader uniform, and have a uniform index select which to show (the shader could sample different UV region based on an index to pick one of several shapes). But often it’s simplest to have separate scenes or materials for very different icons. Recoloring and Theming: Shaders shine here – if all your UI icons are white (or use a mask), you can tint them by a uniform. For example, a shader uniform ui_color can be multiplied with the base color. Or even without a custom shader, Sprite3D’s material can use vertex color or an albedo color. In StandardMaterial3D (Godot 4’s built-in material), you can set Albedo Color to tint the texture. You could also use the node’s self_modulate in Godot 3.x or in Godot 4, attach a CanvasItem as overlay... (since Sprite3D isn’t a CanvasItem, better to tint via material). With a ShaderMaterial, exposing a uniform vec4 color is the easiest way. Then call in GDScript: sprite3d.material.set_shader_parameter("color", new_color) when you need to update it. Because this is so common, Godot 4 introduced per-instance shader parameters which avoid needing unique material resources for each object: you can set a shader uniform on one instance without affecting others that share the same ShaderMaterial
forum.godotengine.org
forum.godotengine.org
. Under the hood, you mark the uniform with the instance keyword in the shader code, or simply call sprite3d.set_instance_shader_parameter("color", new_color) in code, and Godot will use a per-object value for it. Enabling/Disabling States: A disabled button might be grayed out and non-interactive. You can achieve this by toggling the collision object’s monitorable or collision_layer so it no longer receives input, and simultaneously adjusting its appearance. Appearance could be dimming its color (e.g. multiply color by 0.5), or applying a shader effect like making it monochrome. If your shader knows an is_enabled uniform, you could do color = is_enabled ? base_color : mix(base_color.rgb, vec3(luminance(base_color.rgb)), 0.8) to blend it toward gray. Or simply have an alternate texture that is grayed and swap it. Since performance for a few UI elements is not a big issue, clarity is key: sometimes using two materials (normal and disabled) and just assigning the appropriate one might be simplest. Godot allows you to preload both and then do mesh_instance.material_override = disabled_material when needed. If using ShaderMaterial, you could also animate a “grayscale” effect by adjusting saturation in the shader. Material Overrides vs Shared Materials: In Godot, MeshInstance3D (and thus Sprite3D) can either use the mesh’s surface material or an override. Sprite3D by default uses a simplified material for the sprite. If you want to apply a custom ShaderMaterial, you assign it as the material_override on the Sprite3D (in Godot 3) or set the Sprite3D.texture to a ShaderMaterial resource in Godot 4 (Sprite3D in 4.x actually inherits GeometryInstance3D, so you can use set_surface_override_material(0, my_material) if needed). Using a single ShaderMaterial resource for many UI elements is efficient for rendering (they can be batched if state allows), but then all share the same parameter values. That’s where per-instance parameters help: Godot 4’s instance uniforms let each node have its own value without duplicating the material resource
godotengine.org
godotengine.org
. In Godot 3.x, this feature wasn’t available, so you often had to duplicate the material for each element to give it a different color or value (or use workarounds like setting unique vertex color data). Thus, in Godot 4, prefer writing shaders with instance uniform for any variable that will differ per element, and then in code use node.set_instance_shader_parameter("param", value). This keeps your UI materials manageable (one shader file for all buttons, for example) while still allowing variety. For example, you might have a single “ButtonShader” that has uniforms: instance uniform vec4 base_color; instance uniform vec4 hover_color; instance uniform float hover_blend; – your shader interpolates between base and hover color by hover_blend. All UI buttons use this one material, but each button node can set its own base_color (e.g. different theme colors) and will get its own hover transitions. This is very powerful and clean in Godot 4
forum.godotengine.org
godotengine.org
. Dynamic Icons via Shaders: As an advanced note, you can even draw simple icons with math (for example, a “+” sign icon could be two rectangles, or a ring icon could be one circle minus a smaller circle). Shaders can use step functions or shape equations to do that. If you have many such icons, consider using a small set of uniform parameters to define which shape to draw (like an enum value the shader uses to branch). But branching in shader isn’t always cheap, so only do this for very stylistically similar icons. Otherwise, stick to swapping textures or materials for completely different shapes.
Structuring and Animating 3D UI Menus with Depth
When integrating UI panels or menus into a 3D scene, it’s important to structure the scene and nodes for both proper rendering and easy animation:
Scene Structure: It often makes sense to create your UI menu as a separate scene (e.g. Menu3D.tscn) with a root Node3D. Under that, you might have a MeshInstance3D for the background panel (a slightly larger quad with a rounded-corner shader for the panel background), and several child Sprite3D or MeshInstance3D nodes for each button or icon. Grouping them under a common parent allows you to move/rotate the entire menu together (for example, to position it in front of the camera or attach it to a wall in the world). It also allows bulk show/hide or animating the whole menu (e.g. fade in/out). Each interactive element has its collision child as discussed. Keep the hierarchy shallow – unnecessary bones or additional nodes can complicate input unless needed.
Layering and Depth: In a 3D world, z-fighting (flickering) can occur if two flat surfaces occupy the exact same plane. For example, if you place an icon Sprite3D exactly on top of a panel Mesh, their surfaces might coincide. To avoid this, give a tiny offset in depth: e.g., position the icon node slightly in front of the panel (a few units in the panel’s local Z direction, say 0.01). This ensures the icon is rendered above the panel. Alternatively, you can adjust materials: setting a higher render priority on the icon’s material will draw it after the panel
docs.godotengine.org
, or disabling depth write on icons so they don’t occlude the panel (unshaded materials in Godot have options for depth draw modes). The simplest is usually the geometric offset, since it’s easy and reliable for a flat UI.
Facing the Camera: If the UI should always face the player, you have options. Billboard mode is available on Sprite3D (via SpriteBase3D) which can make the sprite always face the camera
docs.godotengine.org
. For an entire menu panel, you could also write a script in _process to set menu_root.transform.basis = basis_looking_at(camera_position), etc. Godot also offers a BillboardMaterial option for meshes, but using Sprite3D’s built-in billboard is convenient for individual elements. You might set billboard mode to Y-axis if you only want it to rotate around vertical axis (common for world-space health bars that should always turn toward the viewer). For menus that are part of the environment (like a screen on a wall), obviously you’d keep them static or animate them into view instead of billboard.
Animations and Transitions: Use AnimationPlayer or the Tweening APIs to animate the UI in 3D. For example, a menu pop-up might scale from 0% to 100% or move forward from the background. Godot 4’s Tweens allow animating properties with ease (e.g. create_tween().tween_property(node, "scale", Vector3(1,1,1), 0.5)). You can animate spatial nodes’ position, rotation, scale for dramatic effects (a menu rotating in 3D space). You can also animate shader uniforms for subtle effects – e.g., animate a highlight_strength uniform to pulse a selection. Keep animations short and snappy for UI. An AnimationPlayer is useful if you have a predetermined sequence (like an intro animation for the whole menu), whereas tweens are good for state changes (hover, click) that might happen anytime. Both can be used together.
3D Depth Effects: Even though our style is flat, we can leverage depth for nice effects. For instance, you could place menu elements at slight different z offsets to create a parallax when the camera moves (the nearest element moves more relative to far ones). You can also use 3D rotation: flipping a card, or tilting a button on press (like a physical button depress). Minimal UI doesn’t mean you can’t use 3D transforms – just use them in a clean, geometric way. If you do rotate UI elements, consider enabling backface culling off on their materials if they might be seen from behind or you want both sides visible (by default, Sprite3D and most materials cull backfaces, so the element disappears if seen from behind).
Performance Best Practices: A few UI planes won’t dent performance. But if you plan on many, note that each Sprite3D or MeshInstance3D is a draw call (unless they share material and can be batched – Godot 4 can batch some sprites that share material). Try to reuse materials with instance parameters rather than unique materials per node, to improve batching. Keep collision shapes simple (boxes, not excessively subdivided meshes). If a UI panel is far away or not currently interactive, you can toggle area3d.monitorable = false to stop processing its input, or even visibility = false on the whole menu to avoid rendering until needed. Godot 4 is pretty efficient with a few dozen UI elements in 3D, but you should still avoid hundreds of always-on interactive items if possible.
Text in 3D UI: If your menu needs text labels, you have a few options: (a) use a BitmapFont on a Sprite3D (e.g. prerender labels as part of the texture or use a custom dynamic texture), (b) use Godot’s TextMesh (Godot 4 has a TextMesh resource that can convert text to a mesh – you could use it with MeshInstance3D to create 3D text), or (c) use a ViewportTexture to draw normal Control labels onto a surface. Each has tradeoffs: TextMesh gives actual geometry for each letter (which can be lit or depth-tested like 3D, but not flat unless unshaded). ViewportTexture approach (drawing a Label on a 2D viewport and projecting it) might be simplest for multiline text or rich text, but then interactivity is more complex as seen in the “GUI in 3D” demo (you’d forward input into the viewport)

. For a few static labels, converting them to textures or meshes is fine. Ensure any text is readable – if the user can walk around the UI, consider the distance and scale of text (maybe even use a slightly emissive material so it’s crisp).
Godot 3.x vs Godot 4.x Compatibility Notes
Most of the above techniques can be applied in Godot 3.5 as well, but Godot 4 brought some improvements:
Node and API Renames: In Godot 4, many 3D node names have a “3D” suffix (e.g. MeshInstance3D vs Godot 3’s MeshInstance, Area3D vs Area). Adjust your scripts accordingly. The Sprite3D node exists in Godot 3.x too (for 2D textures in 3D). Camera functions project_ray_origin() and project_ray_normal() are available in both, though in Godot 3 they might be camera.project_ray_origin(point) (same usage)
docs.godotengine.org
. CollisionObject’s signals input_event, mouse_entered/exited exist in Godot 3 as well

 – so handling input via Area signals works similarly.
Shader Language Changes: Godot 4’s shader language is largely the same, with some added features. One important addition is instance uniforms and global uniforms
godotengine.org
. In Godot 3, all shader uniforms were per-material only. In Godot 4, if you mark a uniform with instance, it appears in the GeometryInstance3D (or CanvasItem) parameters in the Inspector for each node
godotengine.org
. This is extremely useful for UI as discussed. In Godot 3, achieving the same required either using material.set_param() on a duplicated material for each instance or creative use of vertex color/UV. Thus, migrating to Godot 4 can significantly reduce material clutter.
StandardMaterial3D vs SpatialMaterial: In Godot 3, you might have used SpatialMaterial for unshaded textures (by enabling “Disable Lighting”). In Godot 4, StandardMaterial3D is the equivalent – check “Unshaded” in the material properties to have a flat look. Also, if you used CanvasItem shaders in 3 (for 2D UI), note that in 4 you’d use Spatial shaders for 3D. The shader code itself might need minor changes (e.g. ALBEDO vs COLOR usage), but mostly it’s similar.
Viewport UI vs Sprite3D approach: Earlier, many Godot 3 tutorials for “UI in 3D” used a SubViewport with Control nodes, then displayed via Sprite3D or ViewportTexture. That still works in Godot 4, but Godot 4’s input forwarding had some bugs that are being fixed (the forum mentions a fix coming in 4.4 for a viewport input issue
forum.godotengine.org
). Our Sprite3D/Mesh method avoids those complexities by handling input in 3D directly. If you were doing this in Godot 3, you’d follow essentially the same steps: use an Area, connect signals, etc. One thing to watch in Godot 3 is that you must set the Project Setting “Deliver Input Events” (or use a RayCast) to get the collisions to trigger input events. In Godot 4, it’s on by default when input_ray_pickable is true.
Performance differences: Godot 4 uses Vulkan and changed rendering; 3D batching is improved in 4.x, which might help if you have many Sprite3Ds with the same material. In Godot 3, each Sprite3D was a separate draw (unless using MultiMesh for many identical sprites). So, on Godot 3, you might need to be a bit more cautious about having dozens of UI elements (not usually an issue unless you go really high count). Also, if you use ReflectionProbes or environment effects in Godot 3, they might affect unshaded materials differently than in 4. Test the appearance of your UI panels – you might need to disable environment effects on them (in 4, you can set CanvasItem.shadow_cast etc., but for unshaded it usually doesn’t matter).
Project Upgrade Note: If you port a Godot 3 project to 4, your shaders will be converted to the new syntax. Double-check that any hint_range or constants came through (Godot 4 uses @export in GDScript for inspector, but shader hints remain similar). Collision layers in Godot 4 are 20-bit instead of 32-bit, but that rarely affects UI layers.
With these techniques, you can create interactive menus and HUDs that exist within your 3D world while maintaining a modern flat aesthetic. You get the best of both: the depth and immersion of 3D (panels floating in space or curving around the player) and the clean look of flat 2D design (smooth gradients, round edges, simple icons). By leveraging Godot 4’s shaders and signals, your 3D UI can be as responsive and dynamic as any 2D GUI
