the game is not finished yet

but we got now like 30 error functions to test

the thread somehow got stuck, in new way, way that is kinda impossible to happen?

now i can check every thread, if it is locked or not

so many simple testers

but we must now set a limit on how long a task, can exist?

so i guess i need two simple 

rules

do we have akashic_records container

is it a first run

did 5 second passed since game start?

did threads get stuck

do we have tasks started

but none finished?

that will answer my prayer tommorow probably
