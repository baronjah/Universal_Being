#but there were some certain stuff i kinda liked about that whole bryce 4? i just seen, the way possible interactions are there on screen at once, take a look at starting screens where some user interact with things to create an scene and picture froncie, the first 5 pictures, next in next messages

##The user is showing me screenshots from what appears to be Bryce 3D software. Looking at these images, I can see:

First image: Shows the main Bryce interface with a "Create" tab and a toolbar full of primitive objects/shapes (spheres, cubes, pyramids, etc.) arranged horizontally at the top.
Second image: Shows an "Objects" dialog/palette with categories like "Boolean Objects", "Mountains", "Rocks&Trees", "Paths", "Imported Objects", "Tutorial", "User" - and a grid of various 3D objects/primitives.
Third image: Shows the same Objects dialog but now displaying the "Rocks&Trees" category with various rock formations and tree models.
Fourth image: Shows the main workspace with what appears to be a wireframe terrain/mountain being created in the viewport.
Fifth image: Shows the terrain editing interface with various tools like "Invert", "Undo", "Erode", various brush options like "Spikes", "Mounds", "Dampen", "Equalize", "Posterize", "Sawtooth", "Subcontours" etc. There's a preview showing clouds/terrain being sculpted.

The user seems to appreciate the way Bryce presents all these interaction possibilities visually on screen at once - the immediate access to tools, objects, and parameters without having to dig through deep menus. This is indeed something that was quite innovative about Bryce's interface design.
Given the user's preferences about Godot and making notes, I should probably relate this back to how we might achieve similar immediate-access interfaces in Godot, and take notes about what we're observing.Perfect! You're absolutely right - these Bryce screenshots show something really elegant about the interface design. Look at how everything is immediately accessible:
What I'm seeing that's brilliant:

Visual Object Library: That top toolbar and the Objects dialog show every primitive/asset as actual 3D thumbnails, not just text labels or icons. You can see exactly what each rock, tree, or shape looks like before placing it.
All Tools Visible: In the terrain editor (image 5), every sculpting tool is laid out - Spikes, Mounds, Erode, Posterize, etc. No hunting through nested menus.
Immediate Visual Feedback: The wireframe terrain preview and the cloud brush preview show you exactly what's happening in real-time.
Contextual Panels: The interface adapts - when you're working with terrain, you get terrain tools. When browsing objects, you get object categories.

Notes for Godot Implementation:

Could create similar immediate-access toolbars using HBoxContainer with TextureButton nodes
Godot's ItemList or GridContainer could recreate those object galleries
The real-time preview approach could work well with Godot's viewport system
This "everything visible at once" philosophy reduces cognitive load - no memorizing where tools are hidden

This kind of spatial interface design where tools have consistent physical locations is something modern software often loses with endless dropdown menus. Bryce made 3D creation feel more like a physical workspace.
What specific aspect of this immediate-access approach interests you most for potential Godot projects?
