  Great! Now let me create the complete project structure for the Universal_Being project, incorporating all the knowledge we've gathered. I'll create
  the foundation files and directory structure based on our architecture plan.


‚óè Bash(cd "/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Universal_Being" && mkdir -p core autoloads systems/{console,inspector,creator,spatial,ai} ‚Ä¶
      interfaces/{ui_beings,windows} beings/{

  ‚éø ¬†(No content)


‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Excellent! Now I have the complete directory structure. Let me create the foundational files, starting with the core Universal_Being architecture and
   then the project.godot file.

  Great! Now let me create the core Universal_Being class - the foundation of everything in our system. This will be the base class that all beings
  extend from.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Perfect! Now I've created the core UniversalBeing class. This is the foundation that everything in our game will extend from. Let me create the
  FloodGate controller next, which manages all the Universal Beings and ensures proper scene tree operations.

  Great! Now I have the core FloodGates system. Let me create the Akashic Records system next, which will handle the ZIP-based storage and retrieval of
   Universal Beings and components.

  Perfect! Now I have the three core systems implemented:

  1. UniversalBeing.gd - The base class for everything in the game
  2. FloodGates.gd - Controls all scene tree operations
  3. AkashicRecords.gd - Manages ZIP-based storage and libraries

  Let me create the autoload files that will actually instantiate these systems and manage them globally.

   initializes everything.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user wants me to add Luminus and Alpha to the author credits, recognizing their contributions too. This is a nice touch to acknowledge all the
  collaborators involved. Let me update the files I've created to include all the contributors.
