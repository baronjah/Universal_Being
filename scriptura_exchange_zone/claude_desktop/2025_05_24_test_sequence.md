# 🧪 Test Sequence for Garden of Eden Creation Tool

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# First, manually setup the systems
setup_systems

# You should see:
# "Manually setting up ragdoll and astral beings systems..."
# "🤖 [MainGameController] Setting up ragdoll system..."
# "✨ [MainGameController] Setting up astral beings system..."
# "Systems setup complete! Try ragdoll and beings commands now."
```

### 2. Check System Status
```bash
system_status

# Should show all systems online including:
# - FloodgateController ✅
# - AssetLibrary ✅
# - WorldBuilder ✅
# - ConsoleManager ✅
```

### 3. Test Object Creation
```bash
# Create some objects
tree
box
rock
bush

# You should see:
# "Tree creation queued through floodgate!"
# "Box creation queued through floodgate!"
# etc.
```

### 4. Test Ragdoll Commands
```bash
# Now test ragdoll (after setup_systems)
ragdoll_come
# Should see: "Ragdoll is coming to your position"

ragdoll_pickup
# Should see: "Ragdoll will pickup nearest object"

ragdoll_organize
# Should see: "Ragdoll will organize nearby objects"
```

### 5. Test Astral Beings
```bash
# Test astral beings (after setup_systems)
beings_status
# Should show astral beings status

beings_harmony
# Should see: "Astral beings creating environmental harmony"

beings_help
# Should see: "Astral beings helping ragdoll"
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If commands still don't work after `setup_systems`:

1. **Check for error messages** in the console output
2. **Try spawning a ragdoll first**:
   ```bash
   spawn_ragdoll
   # Then try ragdoll commands
   ```

3. **Check scene tree** - In Godot editor during runtime:
   - Look for MainGame node
   - Should have RagdollController child
   - Should have AstralBeings child

### Common Issues:

**"Ragdoll controller not found"**
- Run `setup_systems` first
- Check if scripts are in correct paths

**"Unknown command"**
- Make sure you're using exact command names
- Use `help` to see all available commands
