Claude, project idea with claude code, terminall app from you, we create to folder, and from there we read files for instruction, and as we go each time, we also change stuff, so we must update previous folders, from the first we went from, we must do that like time checkers? ints? how many times we went somewhere to make project? as in folder 7 we might connecte folder 2 and 5 for new things, so folder 1 need update from start, as we start it all over again but in a way we continue and know it all at once
