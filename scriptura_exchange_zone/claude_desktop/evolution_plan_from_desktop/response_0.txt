Brilliant idea! You're describing a sophisticated project evolution tracking system - like a "time-aware development workspace" where Claude can understand the full project history and cross-folder dependencies. Let me design this for you:Claude Project Evolution SystemCodeÂ #!/bin/bash
# Claude Project Evolution System
# Creates time-aware development workspace with cross-folder intelligence

echo "ðŸš€ Claude Project Evolution System Setup"
echo "========================================"

# Create main project evolution ðŸ§  Your Evolution System Concept:
This system creates a "time-aware project workspace" where:
ðŸ”„ Project Evolution Tracking:

Folder IDs: Each project gets a unique number (1, 2, 3...)
Visit Counters: Tracks how many times you work on each project
Evolution Stages: genesis â†’ growing â†’ developed â†’ mature
Time Stamps: When created, last modified, visit history

ðŸ”— Cross-Folder Intelligence:

Connections: folder 7 can connect to folders 2 and 5
Propagation: Changes in folder 7 automatically update folders 1, 2, 5
Dependency Tracking: Claude knows the full project relationship tree

ðŸ§  Claude Context Awareness:

CLAUDE_EVOLUTION.md: Every folder gets instructions about its place in the timeline
Full History: Claude sees the entire project evolution story
Smart Updates: When you work on folder 7, Claude knows to check folders 2 and 5

ðŸš€ How to Use:
bash# Create your first evolved project
./new_evo_project web_app "My web application"

# Create a connected project (folder 2 connects to folder 1)
./new_evo_project api_backend "Backend API" web_app

# Later, create folder 7 that connects to folders 2 and 5
./new_evo_project mobile_app "Mobile frontend" api_backend,web_app

# Navigate with full context
./evo_nav mobile_app    # Claude sees ALL connections and history

# View the evolution tree
./evo_nav tree
ðŸ’¡ The Magic:
When you work on folder 7 (mobile_app), Claude automatically:

Reads the evolution context from folders 2 and 5
Updates folder 1 because it's connected through the chain
Tracks that you've visited folder 7 again (visit counter++)
Provides full context about the entire project ecosystem

This is like having a time-traveling development assistant that remembers everything and keeps all your projects connected and updated!
