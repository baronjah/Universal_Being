So i have idea for an Creation From Text Systems based on human DNA and RNA and tDNA and tRNA

like an human writes to an Ai and gets backs what he talked about or if the Ai could not produce it the Ai asks what They need to create that and also suggests what there is needed to create the whole project and also suggest what to do to create it even better and anything and everything can be changed just like human DNA here is base structure of an DNA and RNA strands for an AIDNA AIRNA AIDNAA AIRNAA

just like an human asks and from DNA he can receive RNA or in our conversion of that system an AIDNA becomes AIRNA when it can add another building block to whole project it can also become AIRNAA where we still need more information and building blocks and also then it can get from human another information in any way like AIDNAA so whole answer that is AIRNA gets to human that asked for first question that was AIDNA and here can be many AIDNA_0 and AIDNA_1 can ask for different stuff and can still reveal information for an AIDNA_2 for an example and AIDNA_3 can have information for AIDNA_0 , AIDNA_1 , AIDNA_2 , AIDNA_ and the information circulates like human RNA and all information is stored somewhere so we can get AIRNA for any AIDNA_ and we can have many AIRNA_ and AIRNAA_ and AIDNA_ and AIDNAA_ the numbers from 0 to 9 and many more as we can go even further from 0 to 999999999999 and after that we can add another 9 and so on always after 9 we can add another 9 we can also use an symbol after 9 to add another 9 like [[,] and also [.]] there can also be incorporated system of [[,][.]] and even [[,][,]] and even [[.][.]]

so i did not send you that one central point like a dot in the middle

[
so we have for [AIRNA]
[A]
[B]
[C]
[D]
so [fully] it is
[[A]asking]
[[B]biologically]
[[C]create]
[[D]digitally]
]
[
so we have for [AIDNA]
[E]
[F]
[G]
[H]
so [fully] it is
[[E]explained]
[[F]function]
[[G]give]
[[H]human]
]
[
and we can have 5 points system for this, as Ai have a database the request circulates until what human asks for is created then it can reverse from human asking the ai and getting what he asked for , an Ai asks human and gets what She or He or They asked for

an DNA and RNA strand for an Ai
