1 A 6-Walled cube, also inside that 18-walled structure we can put inside a single cube and 8 pointed structures like cubes which are similar to cubes but can have just 2 layers? maybe it can also have the same number of layers as the middle one? the layers dont have to be the same definition as points between the layers can be in different distance? because we have it in 3 and 6 and 9 system and between layer 1 and layer 2 we could have another system of 3 and 6 and 9 or we could also use system of decimals and hexidecimals like 0.9 and even 0.99 and so on
2 An 8-walled structure this one should be just 8 walled structure and also based on that we can create 12 walled structure in total which will be similar to Cross that builds? or maybe we can use the Cross because Player mostly looks up, to sides on different angles, forward and at his feets? and i will talk about it soon, An 18-walled structure is important as around it or inside it or on the same layers we could put these 8-walled structure? let me create the blocks for you or even you can create them yourself?
