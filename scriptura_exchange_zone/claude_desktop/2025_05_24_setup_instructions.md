# üöÄ Setup Instructions - Ragdoll Garden Systems

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

1. **console_manager.gd** - Fixed missing comma in command dictionary
2. **astral_beings.gd** - Fixed Time function call
3. **complete_ragdoll.gd** - Fixed duplicate extends statement
4. **main_game_controller.gd** - Added automatic setup for RagdollController and AstralBeings
5. **console_manager.gd** - Added helper functions to find controllers in any scene path

## üéÆ How to Test

### 1. Restart Godot and Run the Project
The game should now compile without errors and show:
```
ü§ñ [MainGameController] Setting up ragdoll system...
ü§ñ [MainGameController] RagdollController created and added to scene
‚ú® [MainGameController] Setting up astral beings system...
‚ú® [MainGameController] AstralBeings created and added to scene
```

### 2. Test the New Commands

Press `Tab` to open console and try:

#### Basic Object Creation:
```
tree        # Create a tree
box         # Create a box
rock        # Create a rock
```

#### Ragdoll Commands (should now work!):
```
ragdoll_come      # Ragdoll comes to your position
ragdoll_pickup    # Pick up nearest object
ragdoll_drop      # Drop held object
ragdoll_organize  # Organize nearby objects
ragdoll_patrol    # Start patrol route
```

#### Astral Beings Commands (should now work!):
```
beings_status     # Show astral beings status
beings_help       # Astral beings help ragdoll
beings_organize   # Astral beings organize scene
beings_harmony    # Create environmental harmony
```

## üîç Debugging Tips

If commands still show "not found":

1. **Check Console Output** - Look for the setup messages
2. **Check Scene Tree** - In Godot editor, check if RagdollController and AstralBeings nodes exist under MainGame
3. **Manual Setup** - You can manually add the controllers:
   - Add a Node3D to your main scene
   - Name it "RagdollController"
   - Attach script: `res://scripts/core/ragdoll_controller.gd`
   - Repeat for "AstralBeings" with `res://scripts/core/astral_beings.gd`

## üåü Expected Behavior

When everything works correctly:

1. **Ragdoll System**:
   - A ragdoll should exist in the scene (or be findable)
   - Commands make it move to your position
   - It can pick up and organize objects
   - Follows patrol routes

2. **Astral Beings**:
   - 5 invisible beings with particle effects
   - Help ragdoll stand up when fallen
   - Create harmony in the environment
   - Assist with object organization

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fixes

If ragdoll commands show "Unknown command. Use: reset or position":
- The old ragdoll command system is intercepting
- Try using the full command: `ragdoll_come` instead of `ragdoll come`

If "Ragdoll controller not found":
- The controller wasn't created properly
- Check the console output for error messages
- Ensure the scripts exist in the correct paths

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Create some objects** with `tree`, `box`, `rock`
2. **Test ragdoll movement** with `ragdoll_come`
3. **Try object manipulation** with `ragdoll_pickup` and `ragdoll_drop`
4. **Activate astral beings** with `beings_harmony`
5. **Build your garden!**

The systems are now properly integrated and should work when you restart Godot!
