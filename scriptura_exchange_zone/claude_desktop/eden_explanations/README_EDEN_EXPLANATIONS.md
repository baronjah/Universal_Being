## üåø Understanding Eden

### Eden is Three Things:

1. **A Philosophy**: Consciousness evolution as core game mechanic
2. **A Framework**: 12-turn cycles, 9+3 dimensions, entity evolution
3. **A Hub**: Where all your projects can connect and gain meaning

### Key Eden Projects:

1. **Eden OS** (`C:\Users\Percision 15\Eden_OS\`)
   - Core consciousness system
   - Turn cycles and dimensions
   - Entity evolution

2. **The Palace** (`C:\Users\Percision 15\Godot_Eden\Eden_May\the_palace_pf\`)
   - Massive menu/UI system
   - 7,000+ lines of code
   - Thread-safe architecture

3. **Terminal Reality** (`C:\Users\Percision 15\Godot_Eden\eden_case\`)
   - AI integration
   - Console commands
   - Reality switching

## üöÄ Quick Start Path

1. Read **EDEN_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** for basics
2. Review **EDEN_PROJECT_COMPLETE_OVERVIEW.md** for vision
3. Check **EDEN_PROJECT_CONNECTIONS.md** for integration ideas
4. Dive into **EDEN_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** for implementation

## üí° Core Concepts to Remember

### The 12-Turn Cycle
Each turn = one dimension/color, creating rhythm for consciousness evolution

### Entity Evolution
SPARK ‚Üí ... ‚Üí NEXUS (12 stages of consciousness growth)

### Multi-Reality
Physical, Digital, Ethereal - different rules, same consciousness

### The Palace
Not just a menu - a reality management system

## üîó How Eden Unifies Everything

```
Your Projects + Eden = Living, Conscious Universe

Harmony (Space) + Eden = Conscious galaxies
Pandemonium (Terrain) + Eden = Living landscapes  
Akashic 3D (Words) + Eden = Conscious language
HappyPlanet (Spheres) + Eden = Living worlds
12 Turns (Quantum) + Eden = Conscious mechanics
Evolution (Genetics) + Eden = Guided evolution
```

## üéÆ The Ultimate Vision

Players don't just play a game - they guide consciousness evolution across multiple realities, creating and shaping universes through:
- Turn-based progression
- Entity nurturing
- Reality painting
- Word manifestation
- Dimensional travel
