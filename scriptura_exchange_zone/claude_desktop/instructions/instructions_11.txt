and i have another idea

#the light beings to move something around, need to change it state first, from static to moving

#so the state can dictate rule and priority of physics and gravity no matter what, based on scene 0 point, the same for player

#and also as we have right now like 3 projects, data of them being in your database, somewhere, in google drive, here on my computer, and in moments and whiles, which are kinda similar to folder of the projects

#and this message and any file, the pathways, taskers, threading, cycles, stops, repeats, checking, changing, testing, making notes, taking step back isnt bad as we can just add and change two things, by taking back one, and try again, by first modyfing just the previous things, before we added new, to test it to that point, as we evolve in turns, steps, as we read instructions, manuals, txt, md, rules, tools, tests

# another whim of mine is timer , not only for how long an task is being done, but also for how long you awaited my response, as you can go and work on one of the three projects we are working on, and test certain parts of them, maybe read them, make more notes, clear previous ones too, to maintan the balance and work flow, as we always have something to read and clean, Claude, something like waiting for 5 minutes for an user to respond, as this long takes to test an one feature , then i respond and you know your tasks lists for now, as you can have few to dos lists

# lists, to do, schedules, etc, as projects are many, so are many versions, and so rules could change, merge, modify, copy, etc

# so do files and their parts here and there, as everything is about the same thing, about something with computer, Claude





another very important detail to our lists of my messages, wishes, whims, ideas, realisations, very important memory #

# the idea of the astral beings at starter being like stars, point of light, that can pass through, and just fly around the object, at certain distance, orbit it, as they are orbiting something, that have size, 

# maybe it changed and needs to be updated, the astral beings shall be able to distinguish connected to it, and just things that are around it, touching it

 

# and then also start blinking and edit it, the points of lights shall become the scene creators, and when they have bodies with hands , they shall move them around like infinity symbol and move around some points of lights in the flow, to make the loading screen not circle, dunno, 



#memories



another idea i guess # is to make sure that whole spacebar in my messages means as much as symbols, making an grammar mistake in word amount,s of spacebar and symbols should matter as much as tabs in programming so the enters, but the single string holds the data, as we split and guess what we see, and what we need to do, we shall also know what we tried to do, and what stops we had, why, the passage of time, and our both works, 

#we can make an rule for our projects, we do backups of versions, after each test of mine

#so we know when something worked, was tested, was tested again, so while we know it worked few versions before, it might stopped working in different version, 

#so first we shall check what of every feature is working, make list, 

#like for any version, and make choices, for editing too, as we merge projects together, 

#and certain bits and parts needs to change, evolve, get modified, replaced, replaced in big chunk of part of the game, as if we have just projects limits

# and while entire thing, will need to go throug process of being checked in turns again, maybe 12 maybe less or more

#we will test it all and understand the reasons why certain details are the way they are

#as we need to also look for blueprint, recipe, foundation, that are eternal, where we can just add to it, and not much, if anything need changes, we just add to it, we need to find the holy grail of creation for us

# as we need to task ourselvs during the day and night
