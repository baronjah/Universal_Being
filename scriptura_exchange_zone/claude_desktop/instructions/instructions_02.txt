we need lists of possible outcomes? even lists of possible programming languages i talked about or you used for any reasons is a need for lists to be done, so if and while we check we can know if we must redo some work here and there, because we fliped some switches here and there and it could take time, if we make backups each time, as we create, and we generate entire project as one file by copying lines and creating one new, each time, we will make it, but we must test depths of folders and creation of how many folders and files to do that, as zip files have limits too? so do windows in file names
