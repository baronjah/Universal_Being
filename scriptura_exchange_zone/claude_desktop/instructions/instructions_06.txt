as we change and shift, the ways we do it right now, we continue the evolutions and creations, we can stumble upon new project, part of it and create something new from it, for the creations and goals of today, to see what we need and as we create project, files and make game, we also need to come up with names of vars, classes, consts, numbering it, connecting it all in one file of json, even animating it and color, what font and text to use, from the databases we made, choosen and use right now, the godot, but we were doing different projects, on different apps too, and maybe in future we will use different engine than godot, but its simple and nice to use so for now its godot 4.4 which will update one day

each folder like a project, while by its own being a project, each part needs to become its own working project, in rules of whole, the main.gd and layer_0.tscn are the ingredients we need to cook the game, as the whims, wishes tries were there for past two years, so lets bake the game from words, as we can add even more comments to whole files, on top whole goal of the file and its connection, over function information what it does to what it was connected, to what it is, and each line that matters can have its own function too, so we can make big files but focus on more like 555 - 777 lines of code, rest can be comments, to maintain the balace of 80 to 20 percent of code to comments maybe
