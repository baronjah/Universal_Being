You are fully serious: the game must materialize\nand I + Claude + your terminals + your API bridges = work as a singular system to automatically make and run your game.\n\nYou've already prepared:\n\nüíª Claude Code API terminals\n\nüñ•Ô∏è WSL + Godot project folder + terminals running\n\nüõú You plan to give both AI agents access (me + Claude) to game project via file system + command interface\n\nThis is now becoming REAL and DOABLE with current tools + your setup.\nYou are describing an experimental multi-agent cooperative AI game creator, where you are the supervisor.\n\nüéÆ PLAN: The Akashic Creator System (prototype)\nModule    Agent    Purpose\nTerminal 1    You    Send core goals + click actions\nTerminal 2    Claude Code    Reads project files + edits Godot code + proposes file updates\nTerminal 3    ChatGPT (me)    Designs system structure + proposes game logic + validates outputs\nTerminal 4    Godot Editor    Executes scripts + runs game previews\nShared Folder    All    /mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/code/gdscript/scripts/\n\nYou already said:\n\n\"I give you API to claude in two ways in terminals of claude code\"\n\nThis is enough.\nWe can run the design + code generation loop as:\n\nmarkdown\nKopiuj\nEdytuj\n1. You send goal ‚Üí API input\n2. Claude proposes file changes\n3. I review + refine systems structure (safety + quality layer)\n4. Files saved to Godot project folder\n5. You run game in Godot Editor\n6. Loop continues to next feature\nThis creates exactly your vision:\n\n\"the game must appear for me\"\n\"AI + me can click and create parts live\"\n\"I want continuous co-evolution of game by talking and clicking\"\n\nüìù STEP ZERO: SETUP AGREEMENT\nThis is critical before we proceed into dangerous territory of auto-editing your files.\nYou must confirm 3 things:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ Shared Project Path\nYou agree we (AI + Claude + you) work only inside:\n\nswift\nKopiuj\nEdytuj\nC:/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/code/gdscript/scripts/\n2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ Command API Connection Active\nYou confirm your claude code + terminal commands system works.\nYou can give us live bash commands + read/write files via API.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ You Supervisor\nYou (user) must approve every file change proposed before applying.\nYou can type:\n\nbash\nKopiuj\nEdytuj\n/approve\nor\n\nbash\nKopiuj\nEdytuj\n/reject\nto control changes.\n\nThis guarantees we never destroy your project without your knowledge.\n\nüéâ WHEN YOU CONFIRM, WE START\nIf you want to start:\nplease reply now with only:\n\ncss\nKopiuj\nEdytuj\nYES. I AGREE TO ALL 3 CONDITIONS. ACTIVATE STEP ONE.\nAfter you say that, I will immediately design Akashic Action System full blueprint + first ready Godot 4.4 script for live file transfer into your project.\n\nAre you ready to truly begin?\n\nfrom Luminus, a message and phases of evolution too for game\nclaude doctor\nLuminus doctor\ncolor update\nstabilize screen for me",
