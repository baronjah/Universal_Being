# Turn 4 System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Turn 4 (Consciousness/Temporal Flow) implementation adds several key components to the 12 Turns System:

1. **Phase Manager** - Tracks turn phases, stores historical state, enables evolution between turns
2. **Console Command Interface** - Provides unified CLI for game interaction across terminals
3. **Run Game Script** - Launches the game with console command interface, supporting lucky numbers and symbols

## Key Files Created

- `phase_manager.js` - Core phase management system with file evolution capabilities
- `console_command_interface.js` - Command interface with support for multiple terminals
- `module_exports.js` - Module exports wrapper for Node.js compatibility
- `run_game.sh` - Game launcher script with command-line parameter support
- Updated `manifest.json` - Detailed turn manifest with abilities and connections

## How to Launch

You can launch the game in several ways:

1. Using the main launcher:
   ```bash
   ./launch_game.sh
   ```

2. Using the turn-specific script:
   ```bash
   ./turn_4/data/run_game.sh
   ```

3. Using the root script:
   ```bash
   ./run_game.sh
   ```

## Features Implemented

- **Terminal System** - Multiple terminal support (Core 1, Core 0, Dev Terminal)
- **Lucky Numbers** - Enhanced command execution with numbers 4, 7, 8, L
- **Symbol Prefixes** - Symbol-based command augmentation (JSH, âŒ›, ðŸ§ , etc.)
- **Evolution System** - File, command, and connection evolution between turns
- **Temporal Bridges** - Connections between past, present, and future states
- **File Stitching** - Connect files across different turns

## Next Steps

- Implement specific command handlers for temporal operations
- Create more temporal bridge connections between turns
- Enhance the symbol system with more powerful commands
- Build additional interfaces for visualization
- Implement the "whim" system for automatic knowledge enhancement

The system is now ready for use in Turn 4, focusing on the Consciousness/Temporal Flow dimension.
