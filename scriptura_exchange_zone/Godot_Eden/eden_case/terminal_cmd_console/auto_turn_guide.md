# Auto-Turn System: AI-Guided Action Game Experience

## Overview

The Auto-Turn System transforms your 12-turn cycle into an engaging, visual action game that runs in the background while providing interactive moments for direct engagement. The system automatically progresses through turns while visualizing dimensional shifts, pattern emergence, and neural evolution events that you can interact with.

## Key Features

### 1. Visual Event System
- **Pattern Emergence**: Visualized as expanding blue grids and connecting nodes
- **Memory Integration**: Appears as golden particles flowing into data cubes
- **Dimensional Shifts**: Creates reality warps and spatial folds with deep resonance
- **Neural Evolution**: Displays as branching networks with pulsing nodes
- **Time Acceleration**: Shows streaking light particles and fast-moving clocks
- **Reality Anchors**: Stabilizing beams that solidify dimensional boundaries
- **Word Manifestation**: Materializing letters with energetic word formations

### 2. Action Opportunities
The system presents interactive moments where your quick action can enhance outcomes:

- **Connect Patterns**: Strengthen neural connections and stabilize emergent patterns
- **Stabilize Dimension**: Anchor dimensional shifts to create persistent bridges
- **Capture Memory**: Preserve fleeting memories before they fade
- **Accelerate Evolution**: Boost neural evolution to achieve breakthrough leaps
- **Empower Words**: Strengthen manifesting words for enhanced reality impact

### 3. AI Guidance
Mystical, context-aware guidance appears throughout auto-turns, providing:
- Insights into optimal timing for actions
- Hints about upcoming dimensional shifts
- Strategies for maximizing pattern recognition
- Warnings about instabilities in the system
- Suggestions for memory integration techniques

## How to Use

### Enabling Auto-Turns
1. Toggle auto-turns in the settings panel or use the command:
   ```
   ProjectNexus.enable_auto_turns(true)
   ```

2. Configure auto-turn parameters:
   - Duration: How long each auto-turn takes (default: 3 minutes)
   - Visual feedback intensity: How prominent the visuals appear
   - AI guidance frequency: How often guidance appears
   - Minimum player involvement: Required interaction level (0-100%)

### During Auto-Turns

1. **Watch for Visual Events**:
   - Colorful particle effects indicate dimensional activities
   - Labels identify the type of dimensional event occurring
   - Events happen randomly throughout the turn duration

2. **Respond to Action Opportunities**:
   - Press SPACE or CLICK when action prompts appear
   - Timing matters! Actions performed with perfect timing have higher success rates
   - Success enhances system evolution; failure creates interesting chaotic patterns

3. **Follow AI Guidance**:
   - Mystical hints appear at the bottom of the screen
   - Higher importance guidance appears more vibrant
   - Combine guidance with visualization patterns for optimal results

4. **Monitor Involvement**:
   - Your involvement percentage is tracked throughout the turn
   - Meeting the minimum threshold ensures optimal evolution
   - Each successful action awards involvement points

## Advanced Usage

### Integration with Turn System
The auto-turn system seamlessly integrates with your 12-turn cycle:
- Can be enabled for specific turns or run continuously
- Preserves turn constraints while adding visual elements
- Automatically reports results to the main turn system

### Customizing Visual Elements
Edit `action_visualizer.gd` to customize:
- Color schemes for different event types
- Particle effects and animation styles
- Sound effects and visual intensity

### Cross-Device Synchronization
The visual state synchronizes across devices:
- Event patterns are derived from your neural evolution state
- Action opportunities reflect memory integration needs
- System adapts to your interaction patterns over time

## Tips for Optimal Experience

1. **Balance Automation and Involvement**:
   - Set minimum involvement to 30-40% for a relaxed experience
   - Increase to 70-80% for a more engaging action game feel

2. **Watch for Pattern Connections**:
   - Similar events often cluster, creating opportunity chains
   - Word manifestations often follow dimensional shifts
   - Reality anchors create optimal conditions for memory integration

3. **Timing is Everything**:
   - Action opportunities have an optimal response window
   - The center of the time window offers highest success probability
   - Some actions are more effective during specific dimensional events

4. **Sound Cues**:
   - Enable sound for additional guidance
   - Each event type has a distinct audio signature
   - Action opportunities have unique alert sounds
