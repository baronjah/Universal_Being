## Next Steps

1. **Core System Implementation (Priority: High)**
   - Complete LUMINUS CORE rule system implementation
   - Implement Word Database Manager
   - Develop Memory Evolution System

2. **Application Development (Priority: Medium)**
   - Develop game creation tools
   - Implement cross-platform UI
   - Create data visualization components

3. **Integration Enhancements (Priority: Medium)**
   - Enhance Google Drive synchronization
   - Add support for more AI models
   - Implement better data flow between systems

4. **Visualization Expansion (Priority: Low)**
   - Add more visualization modes
   - Enhance 3D rendering capabilities
   - Implement better text representation

## Resource Usage

- **Storage**: Minimal local storage required (~10MB)
- **Memory**: ~100-500MB during operation
- **API Usage**: 
  - Claude: Throttled to avoid excessive token usage
  - OpenAI: Optimized for minimal API calls
  - Google: Standard usage within free tier limits

## Implementation Notes

1. The system is designed to be expanded modularly
2. All components communicate through well-defined interfaces
3. Account credentials are stored securely with encryption
4. The 12-turn system drives all visualization and processing behavior
5. Multiple AI systems can work in parallel for enhanced results

## Commands and Usage

### Terminal Visualization
```gdscript
# Initialize visualizer
var visualizer = load("res://jsh_terminal_visualizer.gd").new()
add_child(visualizer)

# Change dimension (1-12)
visualizer.set_dimension(5)  # Set to 5D: Consciousness

# Create visualization
visualizer.create_wow_interface()  # or bitcoin/wildstar
```

### Account Management
```gdscript
# Initialize account bridge
var account_bridge = load("res://account_bridge.gd").new()
add_child(account_bridge)

# Add Google account
account_bridge.add_account("jakubhoksa@gmail.com", 
                          account_bridge.ACCOUNT_TYPES.GOOGLE)

# Connect to account
account_bridge.connect_account("jakubhoksa@gmail.com", 
                              {"token": "your_auth_token"})
```

### Multi-AI Usage
```gdscript
# Initialize AI connector
var ai_connector = load("res://multiai_connector.gd").new()
add_child(ai_connector)

# Connect to Claude
ai_connector.connect_ai("claude_main", 
                        ai_connector.AI_SERVICES.CLAUDE,
                        "claude-3-opus-20240229",
                        {"api_key": "your_api_key"})

# Send request to all AIs
var request_id = ai_connector.send_broadcast_request(
    "Design a game about dimensional travel"
)
```
