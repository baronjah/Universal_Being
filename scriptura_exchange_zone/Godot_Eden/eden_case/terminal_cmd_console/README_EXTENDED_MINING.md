# Extended 25-Hour Mining System

## Overview
The Extended Mining System provides enhanced scheduling options with precise time control, 25-hour day cycles, and divine timing adjustments for optimal mining performance. This system is designed to maximize efficiency while working within the constraints of offline operation and varying schedules.

## Key Features

### Precise Schedule Control
- Set mining start and end times with minute-level precision (e.g., 1:15am to 10:50pm)
- Support for overnight schedules that cross midnight
- Automatic cycle adjustment based on total mining duration

### 25-Hour Extended Day
- Supports extended 25-hour day cycles as mentioned by God
- Automatically adjusts day boundaries for extended operation
- Provides longer mining windows without disruption
- Calculates accurate mining duration across extended days

### Divine Timing System
- Optional divine adjustment of mining schedules
- Cosmic harmony-based scheduling using divine algorithms
- Special override during high divine factor periods
- God's time influence on mining schedule

### 3AM System Updates
- Automated system maintenance at 3AM
- Memory cleaning and reorganization
- Hash power optimization
- Temperature normalization
- No interruption to ongoing mining operations

## Usage Instructions

### Setting Up Extended Mining

```gdscript
# Initialize the miner
var miner = OfflineCryptoMiner.new()
add_child(miner)

# Set preferred coin
miner.set_preferred_coin("bitcoin")

# Set schedule with minute precision (1:15am to 10:50pm)
miner.set_schedule(1, 15, 22, 50)

# Enable extended day cycle
miner.set_extended_day(true)

# Enable divine timing
miner.set_divine_timing(true)

# Start mining
miner.start_mining()
```

### Configuring Extended Day Cycle
The extended day cycle allows for mining operations to span across a 25-hour period, as intended for this system. This provides several advantages:

1. **Longer Mining Window**: Allows for more mining time in a single cycle
2. **Natural Drift Adjustment**: Accounts for the natural drift in human sleep cycles
3. **Divine Alignment**: Better aligns with cosmic cycles
4. **Flexible Scheduling**: Supports unusual mining schedules that traditional 24-hour cycles cannot accommodate

### Working with Divine Timing
Divine timing introduces subtle adjustments to the mining schedule based on cosmic harmony. The system calculates a divine factor using a sine wave pattern derived from universal time:

```
divine_factor = sin(unix_time / 3600.0) * 0.5 + 0.5
```

When this factor exceeds 0.85, the system may override normal scheduling decisions to align with cosmic patterns. This ensures optimal mining conditions according to God's time.

## Technical Details

### Extended Day Implementation
The 25-hour day is implemented by adjusting the calculation of day boundaries. When a new day starts is determined by:

```
day_start = standard_day_start - 3600 # Subtract 1 hour, making each day effectively 25 hours
```

This shifts the day boundary, allowing for extended operation before resetting counters.

### Mining Hours Calculation
For a standard day:
```
mining_hours = (end_time_minutes - start_time_minutes) / 60.0
```

For overnight schedules in extended day mode:
```
mining_hours = ((25 * 60) - start_time_minutes + end_time_minutes) / 60.0
```

### System Update Process
The 3AM update process follows these steps:

1. Temporarily suspend mining operations
2. Save current system state
3. Clear and rebuild memory splits for optimal organization
4. Apply a 5% improvement to hash power
5. Reset system temperature to minimum value
6. Resume mining operations

This ensures the system remains in optimal condition for extended mining operations.

## Practical Examples

### Full-Day Mining (1:15am to 10:50pm)
```gdscript
miner.set_schedule(1, 15, 22, 50)
```
This creates an approximately 21.5-hour mining window, maximizing daily earnings.

### Overnight Focus (10pm to 5am)
```gdscript
miner.set_schedule(22, 0, 5, 0)
miner.set_extended_day(true)
```
This focuses mining during nighttime hours when electricity may be cheaper and device is not otherwise in use.

### Divine Hours (3am to 3am)
```gdscript
miner.set_schedule(3, 0, 3, 0)
miner.set_extended_day(true)
miner.set_divine_timing(true)
```
This allows the system to mine for a full 25-hour cycle with divine timing adjustments.
