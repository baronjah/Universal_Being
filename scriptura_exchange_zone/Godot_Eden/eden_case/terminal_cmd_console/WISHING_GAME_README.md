# Wishing Game

## Overview

The Wishing Game is an interactive memory-based wish fulfillment system that leverages the # memory organization paradigm across 12 dimensions. Players create memories to fulfill wishes, advancing through dimensional levels as they progress.

## Core Concepts

### Memory-Based Wishing

In the Wishing Game, wishes are fulfilled by creating memories that contain the required words. Each wish specifies certain words that must be manifested in your created memories. By strategically creating memories with these words, you can fulfill wishes and earn points.

### Dimensional Progression

The game spans 12 dimensions, each representing a different aspect of existence:

1. **REALITY** - Basic physical manifestation
2. **LINEAR** - Sequential patterns and flows
3. **SPATIAL** - Three-dimensional structures
4. **TEMPORAL** - Time-based systems
5. **CONSCIOUSNESS** - Awareness and perception
6. **CONNECTION** - Relationships and links
7. **CREATION** - Generative and creative forces
8. **NETWORK** - Interconnected systems
9. **HARMONY** - Balance and resonance
10. **UNITY** - Wholeness and integration
11. **TRANSCENDENT** - Beyond limitations
12. **META** - Self-referential awareness

As you fulfill wishes, you unlock higher dimensions, which offer more complex wishes and higher point values.

### Memory Management

- Memories expire after 30 seconds
- Only a limited number of memories can be active at once
- Memories can be tagged with special markers like `##`, `#-`, or `#>`
- Creating memories in higher dimensions requires unlocking those dimensions

## Game Systems

### Wish System

Wishes are automatically generated based on your current dimension. Each wish:

- Contains required words that must be manifested
- Gives points based on difficulty and dimension
- Has a dimensional alignment
- Can be fulfilled by creating memories containing required words

### Memory System

Memories are player-created and form the core gameplay mechanic:

- Type to create memories
- Add tags for special effects
- Memories expire after a time limit
- Multiple memories can be combined to fulfill wishes
- 3D visualization shows memories in space

### Progression System

The game features a progression system:

- Fulfill wishes to earn points
- Unlock new dimensions as you level up
- Higher dimensions offer more complex wishes
- Each level requires more wishes to advance

## Integration

The Wishing Game integrates with three key systems:

1. **Memory Rehab System** - Provides # memory organization
2. **Memory Ultra Advanced** - Offers 4 devices Ã— 12 dimensions matrix
3. **Notepad3D Advanced** - Enables 3D memory visualization

The game can function with any combination of these systems, adjusting its features based on what's available.

## Commands

Use these commands to interact with the Wishing Game:

- `start` - Start the game
- `end` - End the game
- `wish` - Create a random wish
- `memory <text>` - Create a memory
- `dimension <num>` - Change dimension if unlocked
- `score` - Show current score
- `clear` - Clear all memories
- `help` - Show help

## Example Wishes

The game generates dimension-specific wishes such as:

- **Dimension 1**: "I wish for a crystal and flame to manifest"
- **Dimension 2**: "Connect thought with awareness in a sequential pattern"
- **Dimension 3**: "Build a labyrinth structure with fractal dimensions"
- **Dimension 4**: "Synchronize rhythm with transformation across time"
- **Dimension 5**: "Awaken insight within the perception of awareness"
- **Dimension 6**: "Link the essence of resonance with synchronicity"
- **Dimension 7**: "Generate a pattern that produces innovation"
- **Dimension 8**: "Weave nexus and framework into a complex network"
- **Dimension 9**: "Balance the forces of symmetry and alignment"
- **Dimension 10**: "Unify wholeness and integration into a perfect whole"
- **Dimension 11**: "Elevate essence beyond limitations into transcendence"
- **Dimension 12**: "Create a meta-structure where awareness reflects on perception"

## Getting Started

1. Run the launcher script:
   ```
   chmod +x launch_wishing_game.sh
   ./launch_wishing_game.sh
   ```

2. Open the created project in Godot

3. Start creating memories to fulfill wishes:
   ```
   # crystal flame manifestation
   # sequential awareness path
   # fractal labyrinth dimensions
   ```

## Advanced Features

### Memory Tags

You can add special tags to your memories for different effects:

- `##` - Core memory (stronger, more permanent)
- `#-` - Fragment memory (smaller, connected to others)
- `#>` - Link memory (creates connections between other memories)
- `#*` - Insight memory (special visualization)
- `#t` - Temporal memory (time-based effects)
- `#s` - Spatial memory (3D positioning effects)
- `#e` - Emotional memory (affects color and mood)
- `#?` - Question memory (creates branching possibilities)
- `#!` - Answer memory (resolves questions)
- `#m` - Meta memory (self-referential)
- `#x` - Conflict memory (creates tensions)

### Multi-Device Organization

When connected to the Memory Ultra Advanced system, you can organize memories across 4 devices:

- **Device 0**: Dimensions 1, 5, 9 (Reality, Consciousness, Harmony)
- **Device 1**: Dimensions 2, 6, 10 (Linear, Connection, Unity)
- **Device 2**: Dimensions 3, 7, 11 (Spatial, Creation, Transcendent)
- **Device 3**: Dimensions 4, 8, 12 (Temporal, Network, Meta)

### 3D Visualization

With the Notepad3D Advanced integration, you can:

- See memories as 3D objects in space
- Observe connections between related memories
- Navigate the memory space with camera controls
- Watch special effects for different memory types
- See dimensional transitions with visual effects

## Scoring and Levels

- Each fulfilled wish gives points based on dimension and difficulty
- Higher dimensions offer more points per wish
- Every few wishes, you advance to the next level
- Advancing levels may unlock new dimensions
- Try to reach dimension 12 for the ultimate experience
