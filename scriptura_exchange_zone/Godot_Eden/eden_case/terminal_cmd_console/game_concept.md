# ShapesRealm - 3D Interactive Shapes Game

## Concept
ShapesRealm is a 3D game where players manipulate geometric shapes across multiple dimensions to solve puzzles and create new realities. Each shape has unique properties and can be combined with words to gain special abilities.

## Core Mechanics
1. **Shape Manipulation**: Move, rotate, and scale basic 3D shapes
2. **Word Power**: Apply words to shapes to change their properties
3. **Dimension Shifting**: Move between different dimensional planes (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D)
4. **Reality Creation**: Combine shapes and words to create stable realities
5. **Turn System**: Actions advance a 12-turn cycle that affects the world

## Shapes
- **Cube**: Stable and solid, good foundation for structures
- **Sphere**: Mobile and dynamic, rolls and bounces
- **Pyramid**: Focuses energy, creates directional effects
- **Cylinder**: Connects other shapes, creates bridges
- **Torus**: Creates portals between dimensions

## Word Powers
- **Float**: Makes shapes hover in the air
- **Grow**: Makes shapes expand over time
- **Shrink**: Makes shapes contract over time
- **Spin**: Makes shapes rotate continuously
- **Pulse**: Makes shapes emit energy waves
- **Merge**: Allows shapes to combine

## Dimensions
- **1D Point**: Shapes exist only as points of energy
- **2D Line**: Shapes exist as flat projections
- **3D Space**: Shapes exist in their normal form
- **4D Time**: Shapes exist across their timeline simultaneously

## Game Modes
1. **Puzzle Mode**: Solve spatial and word-based puzzles
2. **Creation Mode**: Freely create and save your own shape realities
3. **Challenge Mode**: Complete objectives within a time limit

## Controls
- WASD: Move camera
- Mouse: Look around
- Left Click: Select/manipulate shapes
- Right Click: Apply words to shapes
- Space: Dimension shift
- Tab: Advance turn
- E: Interact with shapes

## Visual Style
- Minimalist geometric shapes with soft glow effects
- Different color palettes for each dimension
- Particle effects for word powers
- Simple but atmospheric environment

## Sound Design
- Ambient, procedurally generated music based on shapes in scene
- Unique sound effects for each word power
- Dimensional shift creates distinctive audio transition
- Turn advancement triggers subtle audio cue

## Technical Requirements
- Godot 3.5+ or 4.0+
- 3D physics for shape interactions
- Shader effects for dimensional transitions
- Simple UI for word selection and turn display
