# Project Summary: Eden OS & Multi-AI Integration System

## Core Components

1. **LunoCycleManager** - Universal 12-turn cycle system
   - Coordinates evolution across all subsystems
   - 12 phases: Genesis â†’ Beyond
   - Implements automatic turn cycling with participant registration

2. **Multi-Account Integration**
   - Account merging for multiple email addresses (jakubhoksa@gmail.com)
   - Tier-based access system (FREE, PLUS, MAX, ENTERPRISE)
   - Visual account representation with color coding

3. **API Orchestration**
   - Connections to multiple AI services (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft)
   - Offline capabilities with request queuing
   - Dynamic API switching with health monitoring
   - Self-diagnostic features

4. **Memory Management**
   - Memory splitting and merging system
   - Dimensional memory mapping across 12 dimensions
   - Message history preservation
   - Wish tracking and evolution

5. **Terminal Interface**
   - Customizable toolbar system
   - Color theme customization (white, blue, green, grey, red, orange)
   - Multi-window support with window switching
   - Command processing system

6. **Offline Security**
   - System self-diagnostics
   - Firewall implementation with offline checking
   - Multiple security levels (standard, enhanced, divine)

7. **Wish System**
   - Casino-like reward structure
   - Task management through wishes
   - Automatic wish processing
   - Implementation planning for game elements

8. **Cross-Device Support**
   - ARM Linux device compatibility (iPad M2, MacBook)
   - Resource optimization for mobile
   - Performance monitoring

## Implementation Priorities

1. Implement LunoCycleManager as core evolution system
2. Extend API orchestration for multi-AI integration
3. Create self-diagnostic system for health checking
4. Implement advanced memory management
5. Design customizable terminal interface
6. Add multi-account email integration
7. Optimize for ARM devices

## Technical Notes

- Godot 4.4 as development platform
- GDScript for core implementation
- JSON configuration for API keys and settings
- Signal-based architecture for system communication
- File-based persistence for offline functionality

## Evolution Pathway

The system evolves through 12-turn cycles, with each cycle advancing the capabilities:

1. **Genesis** - Create data structures
2. **Formation** - Assign paths, build nodes
3. **Complexity** - Establish connections
4. **Consciousness** - Begin monitoring
5. **Awakening** - AI auto-tracking + self-checks
6. **Enlightenment** - Optimize relationships
7. **Manifestation** - Generate new entities
8. **Connection** - Network interactions
9. **Harmony** - Balance memory + performance
10. **Transcendence** - Remove limits (dynamic scaling)
11. **Unity** - Integrate all systems
12. **Beyond** - Reset cycle or start expansion

Every 12 cycles, Eden self-restarts and evolves to the next level, creating a continuous improvement system.
