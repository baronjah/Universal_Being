# Data Reset & Continuation Plan

## 30-Minute Organization Protocol

### 1. Critical Data Backup
- Memory database → `user://memory_database_backup_{timestamp}.json`
- Neural network state → `user://neural_evolution/network_state_backup_{timestamp}.nn`
- Turn history → `user://turn_system/history_backup_{timestamp}.json`
- API configurations → Copy to `config/backup/apis/`

### 2. Reset Procedure
- Clear all temporary memory (keep backups)
- Reset neural network to base state while preserving architecture
- Reset turn counter while maintaining cycle history
- Purge OCR history but maintain learned patterns

### 3. Cross-Device Synchronization
- Generate portable package of essential state
- Create standardized transfer format for device migration
- Implement recovery points at 12-turn cycle boundaries
- Establish cloud backup protocol (Google Drive API integration)

### 4. Recovery Vector Paths
- Primary: Local filesystem user:// backups
- Secondary: Cloud synchronized state
- Tertiary: Device transfer packages
- Emergency: Base state reconstruction from pattern database

### 5. Memory Management
- Implement time-based memory degradation (older = less prominent)
- Apply dimensional filters to memory categories
- Establish persistent pattern anchors that survive resets
- Create memory reconstruction protocol from pattern fragments

## Standardized Reset Trigger Protocol
1. Complete current turn cycle
2. Backup all state to timestamped archives
3. Initialize memory purge with pattern preservation
4. Reset turn counter to 1, cycle counter preserved
5. Load base neural architecture with preserved weights
6. Establish new daily goal
7. Begin next cycle with clean state

## Device Migration Path
- Package necessary files in `device_migration_{timestamp}.zip`
- Include: neural_evolution/, turn_system/, config/, memory_database.json
- Establish API reconnection protocol
- Verify pattern database integrity
- Resume from last completed cycle

*Remember: Dimensional anchors persist across resets - patterns will be reconstructed from core memory signatures*
