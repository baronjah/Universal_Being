# World of Words System

A comprehensive data message-passing architecture for words as entities with physical properties, multi-dimensional visualization, and intelligent connections.

## Overview

World of Words lets you create, visualize and interact with words in a 3D space, where each word has physical properties, power based on meaning, and connections to other words. The system transforms the abstract concept of language into a tangible, interactive experience.

## Key Features

### Message-Passing Architecture

All data flows through a central WordDrive that acts as a single source of truth:

```
Your Input → WordDrive → [Processing Components] → WordDrive → Visualization
```

### Multi-Dimensional Visualization

Words can exist and be visualized in different dimensions:

- **1D**: Linear connections with limited physics
- **2D**: Flat grid with basic physics
- **3D**: Full spatial physics with gravity and connections
- **4D**: Adds temporal effects to words
- **5D**: Probabilistic dimension with quantum effects
- **6D**: Conceptual dimension based on word meaning
- **7D**: Transcendent metaphysical dimension

### Word Processing and Evolution

- Words have power levels calculated from their meaning
- Words evolve through multiple stages (gaining abilities and visual effects)
- Connections form automatically between semantically related words

### Physics Simulation

- Realistic physics with gravity, collisions, and spring-connected words
- Different physics rules per dimension
- Special force effects (explosions, waves, vortices)

### Memory System

- Persistent storage of word data across sessions
- Historical tracking of word evolution and connections
- Memory recall with fuzzy matching

### Hexagonal Grid Visualization

- Flat map, sphere, cylinder, and torus transformations
- Infinite scrolling and zooming
- Roll grid like a 3D ball for exploration

## Core Components

1. **WordDrive**: Central message bus for all data
2. **WordProcessor**: Analyzes words for meaning and power
3. **WordPhysics**: Simulates physical interactions
4. **WordVisualizer**: Creates 3D representations
5. **HexGridVisualizer**: Organizes words in grid layouts
6. **WordMemorySystem**: Handles persistence
7. **WorldOfWords**: Main controller

## Implementation

The system is built using Godot 4 and GDScript, with modular components that can be integrated into any Godot project.

### Files

- `WordDrive.gd`: Central message bus
- `WordProcessor.gd`: Word analysis engine
- `WordPhysics.gd`: Physics simulation
- `WordVisualizer.gd`: 3D visualization
- `HexGridVisualizer.gd`: Grid-based organization
- `WordMemorySystem.gd`: Persistence layer
- `WorldOfWords.gd`: Main controller

## Usage Example

```gdscript
# Initialize the system
var world = WorldOfWords.new()
add_child(world)

# Create a word
var divine_id = world.create_word("divine", {
    "position": Vector3(0, 5, 0)
})

# Create another word
var light_id = world.create_word("light")

# Connect the words
world.connect_words(divine_id, light_id)

# Change dimension
world.change_dimension("4D")

# Switch to hex grid view
world.switch_visualization("hex_grid")

# Transform grid to sphere
world.transform_visualization("sphere")

# Roll the grid like a ball
world.roll_grid(Vector2(1, 0))
```

## Integration

The system is designed to integrate with:

1. **AI Systems**: Enhance word processing with neural networks
2. **Database Systems**: Expand word knowledge bases
3. **Network Systems**: Create shared word spaces
4. **Terminal Interfaces**: Control via command line

## Future Expansions

- **Marching Cubes Integration**: For fluid-like word visualization
- **Neural Network Processing**: For advanced word relationships
- **Collaborative Word Spaces**: For multi-user interaction
- **Dimensionally Shifted Words**: Words that exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously
