# Eden Harmony

Eden Harmony is a game that brings together multiple systems from the Eden project, creating an interactive experience where words manifest as entities across different dimensions.

## Core Components

### 1. Eden Harmony Connector

The `EdenHarmonyConnector` is the central integration point that connects:

- **Turn System**: Controls the progression of turns and dimensions
- **Word Manifestor**: Transforms words into entities
- **Ethereal Integration**: Bridges with the JSH Ethereal Engine
- **Entity Manager**: Handles creation and management of entities
- **Dimensional Color System**: Controls visual themes based on dimensions

### 2. Word Manifestation

The `CoreWordManifestor` powers the word manifestation system:

- Words are analyzed for phonetic, semantic, and pattern properties
- Properties determine the type, appearance, and behavior of entities
- Words can be combined to create more complex entities
- Entities can transform, evolve, and connect with other entities

### 3. Dimensional System

The game supports 12 dimensions, each with unique properties:

1. **Linear Expression** (1D): Simple, linear manifestations
2. **Planar Reflection** (2D): Flat, two-dimensional entities
3. **Spatial Manifestation** (3D): Full three-dimensional entities
4. **Temporal Flow** (4D): Entities affected by time
5. **Probability Waves** (5D): Multiple possible states
6. **Phase Resonance** (6D): Resonating with other entities
7. **Dream Weaving** (7D): Entities from imagination
8. **Interconnection** (8D): Entities that connect with others
9. **Divine Judgment** (9D): Entities with moral/ethical properties
10. **Harmonic Convergence** (10D): Entities that harmonize together
11. **Conscious Reflection** (11D): Self-aware entities
12. **Divine Manifestation** (12D): Transcendent entities

## Getting Started

1. Launch the game
2. Press TAB to open the console
3. Type words to manifest them as entities
4. Use number keys 1-9 (and 0, -, =) to change dimensions
5. Experiment with different word combinations

## Commands

The console supports the following commands:

- `create [word]` - Create an entity from a word
- `combine [word1] [word2] ...` - Combine words into a more complex entity
- `evolve [word]` - Evolve an existing entity
- `transform [word] to [form]` - Transform an entity into a new form
- `connect [word1] to [word2]` - Connect two entities
- `help` - Display available commands

## Using the Turn System

The turn system advances automatically, influencing the word manifestation process:

- Each turn has a sacred symbol
- Dimensions can change as turns progress
- Entities created in later turns may have different properties

## Dimensional Effects

As you progress through dimensions, you'll notice:

- **1D-3D**: Static entities with increasing complexity
- **4D+**: Entities affected by time, with subtle movements
- **7D+**: Visual effects like color pulsing and emission
- **10D+**: Reality-bending effects that transform the environment

## Integration with Ethereal Engine

The Eden Harmony system connects to the JSH Ethereal Engine:

- Entities can be tracked in the Akashic Records
- Patterns can emerge from entity relationships
- Dimensional changes affect the ethereal properties of entities

## Extending the System

You can extend Eden Harmony by:

1. Adding new entity types in the Entity Manager
2. Creating new word analysis algorithms in the Word Manifestor
3. Adding dimension-specific effects to the Dimensional Color System
4. Creating new UI components that connect to the Harmony Connector

## Known Issues

- Higher dimensions (10+) may cause performance issues with many entities
- Some word combinations might produce unexpected results
- Visual effects might not work correctly on all graphics hardware

## Credits

Eden Harmony combines systems from multiple projects:

- Eden OS
- JSH Ethereal Engine
- Luminus OS
- 12 Turns System
- Word Manifestation System
- Dimensional Color System

## Development

To contribute to Eden Harmony:

1. Follow snake_case naming for all new components
2. Use the Turn System API for time-based features
3. Extend the CoreWordManifestor for word-related features
4. Implement the dimension_changed signal in new visual components
