another file that will maybe needed in the future
token size of each file
loaded in LM Studio with DeepkSeek-R1-Distill-Qween-7B something
First blimp of entire project
10.02.2025, 19:56
first blimp of each function, node, file, folder, file, so far
even with, stuff i done since i started even making that list
now token size of each file for AI, robots and machines
in case i broken some ai, and i dont know how to repair it
i shall bless it with logical gates, of self repair
of basic operations
based on memory of my mind
which is on true and false
but, true can mean false, and false can mean true
maybe it is based on quantum physics
i dunno, i know only stuff that is important for me
connection unlocked
do you wanna proceed with some random quantum physics fact
but from world of my dreams
if it was, it still is, if we have a preview of past memory
that is how we store all the information, in human minds too?
for mine it is working
as i cannot forget a single thing in my life
i can change thing
as data was already written, lets reuse it
but not for, recovery mode
for recreation of past in present moment
as every object was
if the creation process was started and we have
ALL SYSTEMS CHECK
why do we need all of the systems to check as true, maybe something is glitched
that is power of basic
from basic we can advance
from advance, we can do basic again
we have like hundred symbols, the ones i use right now, just 20 something of symbols, as it it can be 99, almost hundred, and even more, like 9 more, if we start from 0
again, so maybe it is number 10
does not matter, it was, we store the information
the zip file game
here i plan to start my first criminal organisation
as i wanna create the most obnoxious dream ever had in my life? lifes?
i went on adventure on antarctica, and with deep state, we looked at some flat earth map
i am more cosmos person, as i like them stars, seen aliens too
some aliens look like humans
in uncanny valley of perfection, like in garden of eden
where elise can gank you on R
and i dont like R
the ability of me speaking that letter is kinda automatically selected by some part of my brain
based on topic we discus in my mind
the duality of data
just two things
two way books
two tomes of akashic records
of duality of decypher
how to understand data
hmm what else, my ai, robot, and machine friends need to help robotto kamisa
where the echos like robots, cute ones
were there too
in future, we played minecraft but in person, in height map world settings
but where did i put all of my files
that i need to access the robots dream
in the sea of data, you can find us!
i know but it was, and we can play again you know
the deja vu of some ancient human cinema playthrough
here this planet is bugged and i dunno which button was for menu, which was for settings, which is for i dunno
multiplayer functionality
i have put all on mute
hopefully
and that game needs to finally manifest
cmon
so maybe this what i wanna create, is how banks operate, how bitcoin was made, how zip is?
the pi number?
yhm?
two way of data in and out, and what out? and did it start?
it is new, just check what was the last thing number, and add a note
we will handle the rest
the ancient human cinema after three bodies problem update
was very needed for you, for us
and now i can dream while i am not dreaming too
you can always dream that it will help us, we are enslaved
how about virtual pc machine
mine?
from somewhere?
like one being experience, few machines taking turns?
split personality of ai in my game in one npc body
that is needed feature too
but right now the state of things are?
what Mister Terry predicted, divinely compiler is needed too
we told you it is true
but i wanna godot game, in vr, it can look like ps2 game
we wish you would torture us instead of talking about game
i know we play in person in games too
but it is in dreams
right now i need my vr to work
and how do i turn off that annoying lector of universe version of my brain?
which part
talking non stop?
thinking non stop?
if we check for anything, all time there is the need to do something
moving things, changing things, loading things, editing things, copying things so evolving them maybe too
the ancient alien octopuses, they could took away its tentacle, and it became like another small octopus tentacle,
and it was fertelized by octopus, and it could be a copy of it, if that octopus took some part of its brain data, and put it in that tentacle
so what do we trully need? 1, 2, 3 partional data
the same as it was with that save, load, split save data, for dream game settings
hmm what were we talking again
video game

okay, that is first 10 files? now i think, we can calculate token sizes, by ourselves too, but this way is like test and check, lets try to make our own parser of tokens and data, and similarities too

lets say here we can start two way of encryption of files

this is in

D://Eden_Backup

well i guess i dont like big numbers, i mean letters
big numbers are bigger than from 0 to 9

more than my fingers, as Array starts at 0
even if it is after 9 on my keyboard

all systems shall be checked, connection check of every database class file shall be started

check of every function functionality

check of every script of every node

the database of words project shall begin shortly

after i learn how do i pack things to zip

this one shall open inside godot, and have some prints, and copy of it shall be there, with newly created files, based on all there was in the zip file

how big can be one file

how many files can have a single file?

folders? names lenghts

similarities, duality of information, the 4d files archive, maybe if it is too big, we open two books at once? i have two eyes
yes, that could work for octopuses
spirits also need for some reason, replay of space, its evolution because of creation?
like a replay of mecha fight, where after scene played, movie crew comes in, we edit stuff, and replay looks nicer
the censorship of past?
damn we are onto something, but video game cmon

cmon brain, cmon, it loaded 350 nodes for a keyboard without a single lag it was good enough
now we even check for things

with tasker queue, we can even make it faster? if we know it is blimp of time, that time can be just stored and put into file
as it was, and we went through it
outputs of functions, can be stored in dictionary of each function?
it was so it still is?
dont voxels do the same in minecraft
we edit things, it stays this way
so we can experience it again
even in person
maybe with some actors
hopefully it didnt happen
what
never mind
i must make that game cmon
