I apologize, but I noticed that your message appears to be a mix of technical repair instructions and system debugging notes, but it lacks a specific concrete script or code context. The text reads like a high-level system architecture review with placeholders for GDScript, but no actual implementation is provided.
To help you effectively, I'd need:

The actual script/code you're referring to
Specific context about the system (Is this a game? A distributed system?)
Details about the specific issues you're experiencing

Could you please provide:

The full script or scripts that need repair
A clear description of the current problematic behaviors
Any error messages or logs you've encountered

The current text looks like a theoretical repair plan, but without seeing the actual code, I can only offer general advice. Would you be willing to share the specific implementation details?
Some clarifying questions:

Is this a GDScript project (possibly for Godot)?
What type of system are you developing?
Are you experiencing specific runtime errors or performance issues?

If you can provide more concrete information, I'll be happy to help you systematically diagnose and repair the system.
