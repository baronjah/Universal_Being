### now i need some tree of godot scene tree to compare, and connect stuff here too 

# Usage example in _ready() or as a standalone function

	var metrics = get_system_metrics()
	print("🔍 System Metrics:")
	for key in metrics:
		print(key)
		#print(f"{key}: {metrics[key]}")

### third cleaning of data










## camera and its nodes, have some more
# additionally camera addon file
camera_move, camera_mover
# for node i dunno, sphere so maybe planet generator too?

# the main file, and new project_architecture file
main, project_architecture
# nodes for main, and project architecture
Node: main, WorldEnvironment, JSH_mainframe_database
## code segments for that from main

## code segments of scripts

## database of files, creation from, created from, will create from, will compare, will evolve, will duplicate and maybe check something
# records system files so far, so connected to active_record_sets and cached_record_sets

## stuff to do, just in case i would need a button and cursor and some debug line, it happened, but didnt venture further
# we didnt touch too much of that too
button , cursor_pc, line
## code segments for that from main

## code segments of scripts


## functions of each file, in gd script, with descriptions, checks, etc

## code segments for that from main

## code segments of scripts

### stuff to do ? connect main segments here, and we will work more on it now


### we only have main.gd segmented into data type, can this be enought data?
