what we had touched and worked, atleast before i started editing it too much, as i predict things happening
## cube cam
cubecam is working, generates pictures,generates shader picture, can be applied to skybox, shader can be used, to make it bigger, smaller, make it bigger, vertically, horizontally
so basics were there, for me to pick on, we pushed project, but we need our own file for our cubecam usage
## trackball camera
works already, kinda get process from main _process, and so inputs, have also q and e barell roll
it have quanternion, and i will probably need it too



### functions i remember working at first, mostly in different project
## look_at basis, with the same horizontal direction? no weird rotation for 180 degrees, one of nicer functions
last seen in planets 2d sprites, mimicking 3d planets
as we care how we se thing, not how that thing sees itself
## whip out cube cam, make texture file for skybox
the same project have that function, we must scavange it from my sea of data
## shader functions, for skybox, apply it, use it, load a shader into it
it worked nice, the shader have a bug, as it is calculating how far we need to travel to traverse back
it was not enlarging in perfect way, probably easy fix, but i know i can edit skybox as i wish
## the mover for camera, and placement for nodes, i made it once, and didnt really store it in nice way
it is somewhere, in planets project



### stuff that need to happen soon, so i can touch my keyboard again
## real system checks, first some easy
check folders and files
if we have them, we read some settings file and config file
from that we compare data with precodded data from banks of data, we have many already
we create basic and empty dictionaries, get them metadatas, of root state
we load data into
make the storage based on my hallucination, based on akashic records, as spirit are whispering
based on kinda if we repeat, it is fast, if it is new, we kinda check it for you
damn, hope it can change, and we can creat some brakes and handles, not for ai, not for machine
but for ai and for machine, so it wont break, from unknow reasons
we need file parser
we need functions reader
cathegorize all functions in project, in specific txt files, in specific folder, with metadatas, we will be able to make nice lists
with that and my tag system, that works, and i can see, each tag special effects
nice 3d stuff


### well my next personality just switched
## now lets continue from different perspective, my perspective
i write and write, and i think we can start that, by just what i said
