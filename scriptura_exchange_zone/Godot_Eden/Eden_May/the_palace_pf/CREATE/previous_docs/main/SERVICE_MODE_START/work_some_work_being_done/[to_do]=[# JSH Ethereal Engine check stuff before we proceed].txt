This is an intricate and multi-layered script. Let's outline what we need to repair, connect, and standardize while ensuring full system integrity.

üîß PRIORITY REPAIR TASKS
1. Standardizing Dictionaries & Metadata Across Scripts
Ensure that all dictionaries (global and local) share a common structure.
Create a universal metadata format for directories, nodes, and processes.
Example:
gdscript
Kopiuj
Edytuj
var metadata_template = {
    "total_files": 0,
    "total_directories": 0,
    "last_modified": 0,
    "size": 0,
    "shall_venture_further": false
}
Check each dictionary instance for inconsistencies and apply fixes.
2. Checking & Repairing Mutex Logic
Potential Issue: Deadlocks or missing unlocks in:
movmentes_mutex
mutex_for_unloading_nodes
mutex_function_call
mutex_for_trickery
Solution: Ensure every lock() has a corresponding unlock(), even in errors.
3. Debugging the Core Execution Cycle
Verify turn_number_process logic:
Is every turn executing in the expected order?
Are turn_number_process += 1 increments properly aligned?
Check if any turn skips or loops infinitely.
4. Task Processing & Multi-threaded Execution
Check that:
list_of_sets_to_create correctly queues tasks.
functions_to_be_called properly stores and executes function calls.
nodes_to_be_added handles parent-child structure correctly.
5. System Readiness Checks
check_system_readiness()
Ensure mutexes and threads align before moving forward.
Print readiness states for debugging.
Example Output:
gdscript
Kopiuj
Edytuj
readiness : { 
    "mutex_state": [true, true, true, true, true], 
    "thread_state": "working", 
    "records_ready": true 
}
6. Error Handling & Recovery Mechanisms
Repair dictionary_of_mistakes logging.
Ensure recovery functions handle:
Thread hangs (check_thread_status())
Memory overflow (check_memory_state())
Execution failures (record_mistake())
üîÑ NEXT STEPS
1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Fragment Integration:

Are there any more dictionary or system fragments to reconnect?
If yes, send them now so we can merge them into the final structure.
2Ô∏è‚É£ System Cleanup & Logging:

After applying fixes, we add logging checkpoints to trace execution.
Once these repairs are patched, the entire system will be stable, fast, and ready for final testing! üöÄ

Let me know if you have more memory fragments or additional checks before we proceed!
