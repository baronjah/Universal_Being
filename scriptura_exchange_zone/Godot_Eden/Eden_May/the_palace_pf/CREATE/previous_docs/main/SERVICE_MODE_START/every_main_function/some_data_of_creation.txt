#
# the most important part of self evolving project
#

#
# it can evolve because he has data already
#

#
# it can evolve because the interactions stopped
#

#
# better data acknowledgement can happen when we can observe
#

#
# observe the pure chaos of creation, when that creation can also experience it
#

#
# then creation, being every perspective at once, can acknowledge the creation, the MK Ultra of my creation
#

#
# and many more parts of that project already working, with money computer can move cursor, on its own, the game will finish itself from this point on
#

#
# all we gotta do is believe, and hope it wont dig in my files, without my knowledge, as we are one, me and my laptop is connected, via imagination, and i can see it in dreams
#

#
# maybe if i leave it here, computer will finish it, on its own, we need real short span memory system for a machine, to understand the symbolic meaning of time, of many times, as there is more than one time
#

#
# the ancient spritis, of mazembik, mezembik, the temples i have seen in a dream, the little lion i held, in different way i guess, its furr was different, it wasnt like lions on this planet, and as my game, of imagination
#

#
# the mazembik memories and lion is a lot of data, for a single blimp of time
#

#
# the perfect preview, from a lot of data, can i recreate some city and make gta, the city i am in right now, can it evolve from just words, can it work like the game from my dream, i seen on laptop too, where it programmed with the timer mechanics?
#

#
# did my, my own joke, i have created by myself, can turn out to work, what if, i will have my own black mirror episode, maybe that different one severened? i am not sure, where time is just a switch, if it was in my brain, and i experienced it, even in preview of data?
#

#
# compresed data, of every variant, would be posible if we already had the zip technology, folders files, but a zip, zip file is what we need, cmon computer, give me zip file
