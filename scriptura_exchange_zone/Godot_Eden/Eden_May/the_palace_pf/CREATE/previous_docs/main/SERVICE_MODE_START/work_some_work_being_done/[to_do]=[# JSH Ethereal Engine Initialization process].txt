Your JSH Ethereal Engine Initialization Process is designed to ensure a smooth startup, validate the system environment, check thread pool health, and handle potential failures with retry mechanisms. Below are enhancements and optimizations to further stabilize and optimize your initialization process.

🔧 Core Enhancements & Fixes
1️⃣ Improved Thread Health Checks
🔴 Issue: Your check_thread_status() function only returns "working" or "error", but it does not provide detailed insights into individual threads.
✅ Solution: Improve the function to return structured information about thread execution.

✅ Updated check_thread_status()
gdscript
Kopiuj
Edytuj
func check_thread_status() -> Dictionary:
	var thread_info = {
		"status": "unknown",
		"total_threads": OS.get_processor_count(),
		"active_threads": 0,
		"stuck_threads": 0,
		"running_tasks": []
	}
	
	if thread_pool == null:
		thread_info.status = "error"
		return thread_info
	
	# Fetch thread stats
	var thread_stats = thread_pool.get_thread_stats()
	for thread_id in thread_stats:
		var state = thread_stats[thread_id]
		if state["status"] == "executing":
			thread_info["active_threads"] += 1
			thread_info["running_tasks"].append(state["current_task"].target_method)
		if state["is_stuck"]:
			thread_info["stuck_threads"] += 1
	
	# Determine final status
	if thread_info["stuck_threads"] > 0:
		thread_info.status = "stuck"
	elif thread_info["active_threads"] > 0:
		thread_info.status = "working"
	else:
		thread_info.status = "idle"

	return thread_info
2️⃣ Smart Retry System with Limits
🔴 Issue: Retries run indefinitely if the system is stuck, leading to wasted CPU cycles.
✅ Solution: Track retry attempts and abort after 3 failures.

✅ Smart Retry System
gdscript
Kopiuj
Edytuj
var retry_attempts = 0
var max_retries = 3

func _on_retry_timer_completed(timer_id: String):
	if timer_id == "retry_timer":
		if retry_attempts < max_retries:
			print("🔄 Retry attempt:", retry_attempts + 1)
			retry_attempts += 1
			prepare_akashic_records()
		else:
			print("❌ Max retries reached. Aborting system initialization.")
3️⃣ Enhanced Initialization Debugging
🔴 Issue: There’s no detailed log output showing why initialization failed.
✅ Solution: Print structured system diagnostics.

✅ Detailed Debugging Logs
gdscript
Kopiuj
Edytuj
func debug_initialization_status():
	var system_info = validate_system_environment()
	var thread_status = check_thread_status()

	print("\n🔍 **System Initialization Debugging Report**:")
	print("- OS: ", system_info["os"])
	print("- Processor Count: ", system_info["processor_count"])
	print("- Vulkan Version: ", system_info["vulkan_version"])
	print("- GPU: ", system_info["device_info"])
	print("\n🧵 **Thread Pool Status**:")
	print("- Status: ", thread_status["status"])
	print("- Total Threads: ", thread_status["total_threads"])
	print("- Active Threads: ", thread_status["active_threads"])
	print("- Stuck Threads: ", thread_status["stuck_threads"])
	print("- Running Tasks: ", thread_status["running_tasks"])
	print("\n🛠 **Initialization Task State**:")
	print("- Started: ", int_of_stuff_started)
	print("- Finished: ", int_of_stuff_finished)
	print("- Timestamp: ", Time.get_ticks_msec())
4️⃣ Initialization Health Check
🔴 Issue: System may proceed without validating mutex locks, leading to potential deadlocks.
✅ Solution: Perform pre-check before continuing.

✅ Ensure System Readiness Before Proceeding
gdscript
Kopiuj
Edytuj
func initialization_health_check() -> bool:
	var readiness = {
		"mutexes": breaks_and_handles_check(),
		"threads": check_thread_status()["status"] == "working",
		"task_queue": array_of_startup_check.size() > 0
	}
	
	if readiness["mutexes"] and readiness["threads"] and readiness["task_queue"]:
		print("✅ System ready for initialization!")
		return true
	
	print("⚠️ System not ready: ", readiness)
	return false
5️⃣ Prevent Recursive Failures
🔴 Issue: prepare_akashic_records() is called in a loop, potentially re-triggering errors.
✅ Solution: Only re-attempt if conditions change.

✅ Conditional Reattempt
gdscript
Kopiuj
Edytuj
func conditional_retry():
	var status = check_thread_status()
	
	if status["status"] == "stuck":
		print("⚠️ Threads are stuck, retrying...")
		_on_retry_timer_completed("retry_timer")
	elif status["status"] == "working":
		print("✅ Threads are now working, proceeding normally.")
	else:
		print("❌ Unknown system state, aborting retries.")
🔄 Next Steps
1️⃣ Run debug_initialization_status() before starting
2️⃣ Use initialization_health_check() before proceeding
3️⃣ Limit retries with _on_retry_timer_completed()
4️⃣ Log failures for debugging

🎯 Summary of Fixes
✅ Thread health checks improved
✅ Smart retry with limits
✅ Enhanced debug logging
✅ Pre-check before proceeding
✅ Prevention of recursive failures

🚀 Your JSH Ethereal Engine is now optimized for reliable initialization!
