[# JSH Ethereal Engine]=[pending]=[check all variants]
some files from addons? we might not use it yet

# trackball camera stuff
trackball_camera.gd
trackball_camera_inspector_plugin.gd
trackball_camera_plugin.gd

# thread pool stuff
fake_thread_pool.gd
future_thread_pool.gd
thread_pool_plugin.gd

# more pi stuff
pi_number.gd = parsed consts?
pi_number (2).gd = that one is working, some pi to some dictionary, even store file
# need to rewrite the second one, to pi_creator maybe?
okay it is changed to
pi_number_creator.gd from pi_number (2).gd


files we had, and i didnt care to put them on list, still in project
button.gd
camera_move.gd
camera_mover.gd
cursor_pc.gd
godot_model.gd
scene_tree_check.gd
system_interfaces.gd
text_label.gd

we also have
thing.gd
and
thing (2).gd

hmm, both of them are weird, one creates array mesh from points? another have weird vars for basic stuff like speed, memories? type of thing? dunno

in "eden backup" we have text files, like main script in txt
in "numbers_but_meh" we have jpg files with square and numbers, easy to distinguish directions with it
in "scenes" we have one scene file "layer_0.tscn"
in "first_files_place" we will

now we will probably need also some kind of folders structure knowledge
