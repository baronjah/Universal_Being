To complete the integration of the space game with elements, you'll need to make the following changes in your Godot project:

1. Add ResourceManager as a singleton:
   - Open Project > Project Settings
   - Go to Autoload tab
   - Add a new singleton:
     - Name: ResourceManager
     - Path: res://singletons/resource_manager.gd
     - Enable singleton

2. Add the following input mappings:
   - Go to Project Settings > Input Map
   - Add these actions:
     - select: Left mouse button
     - enter_elements: E key
     - toggle_debug: F3 key
     - screenshot: F12 key
     - move_forward: W key
     - move_backward: S key
     - move_left: A key
     - move_right: D key
     - move_up: Space key
     - move_down: Shift key
     - zoom_in: Mouse wheel up
     - zoom_out: Mouse wheel down
     - orbit_rotate: Right mouse button

3. Make sure your scenes are properly saved and paths are correct:
   - Check that all the scene paths in ElementSpaceDemo.tscn point to existing files
   - Verify that all script paths are correctly set

4. To run the space game:
   - Open either space_game.tscn or element_space_demo.tscn
   - Click the Play button in Godot
   - You should start at the universe scale with galaxies
   - Click on galaxies to zoom in to them
   - Use WASD keys to navigate
   - Press Escape to zoom back out

The ElementSpaceDemo scene includes additional paths and functionality:
- Press E when viewing a planet to enter element view
- Press Escape to return from element view to planet view
- Debug information can be toggled with F3
- Screenshots can be taken with F12
