# Akashic Records Quickstart Guide

Once you've integrated the Akashic Records system into your Eden Space Game, this guide will help you start using its key features.

## Creating Your First Words

1. **Open the Akashic Records UI**:
   - Launch the game
   - Go to the "Things" menu
   - Select "Akashic Records"

2. **Create Basic Elements**:
   - Click the "Add Word" button
   - Enter information for your first element:
     - ID: "fire"
     - Category: "element"
   - Click "Confirm"

3. **Add Properties**:
   - Select "fire" in the word list
   - Click "Edit Word"
   - Add properties like:
     - "heat": 0.8
     - "energy": 0.9
     - "light": 0.7
   - Click "Confirm"

4. **Create More Elements**:
   - Repeat the process for "water", "earth", and "air" with relevant properties
   - For example, water could have:
     - "flow": 0.8
     - "transparency": 0.7
     - "temperature": 0.4

## Setting Up Interactions

1. **Create Interaction Rules**:
   - Select an element (e.g., "fire")
   - Click "Add Interaction"
   - Enter:
     - Target Word: "water"
     - Result Word: "steam"
     - Condition: "heat > 0.7"
   - Click "Confirm"

2. **Create the Result Word**:
   - Add a new word "steam" with category "derived"
   - Add appropriate properties:
     - "density": 0.2
     - "temperature": 0.9
     - "visibility": 0.5

3. **Test the Interaction**:
   - Click "Test Interaction"
   - Enter:
     - Word 1: "fire"
     - Word 2: "water"
     - Context: "heat=0.8"
   - Click "Confirm" to see the result

## Exploring Visualization

1. **View the Visualization**:
   - The right panel shows the 3D visualization of words
   - Words are represented as nodes with connections

2. **Try Different Layouts**:
   - Use the layout dropdown to switch between:
     - Radial: Words arranged in a circle
     - Spiral: Words arranged in a spiral pattern
     - Cluster: Words grouped by category or relationship

3. **Interact with Words**:
   - Click on nodes to see details in the middle panel
   - Observe how words with relationships are connected

## Setting Up Evolution

1. **Access Evolution Controls**:
   - Go to "Things" > "Evolution System"
   - You'll see controls for the evolution parameters

2. **Configure Parameters**:
   - Evolution Rate: Controls how quickly properties drift (try 0.05)
   - Evolution Interval: Seconds between cycles (try 60)
   - Variant Threshold: Usage count needed for variants (try 10)
   - Variant Probability: Chance of creating variants (try 0.3)

3. **Trigger Evolution**:
   - You can either:
     - Wait for automatic evolution after the interval
     - Click "Trigger Evolution Cycle" for immediate effect

4. **Observe Changes**:
   - After evolution, you'll see:
     - Properties gradually changing
     - New variants appearing for frequently used words
     - Updated visualization showing relationships

## Testing with Real Usage

1. **Record Word Usage**:
   - Use words in interactions to increase their usage count
   - Words with higher usage evolve faster and generate variants

2. **Check Evolution Statistics**:
   - Watch the Statistics panel for:
     - Evolution cycles count
     - Number of variants generated
     - Word count in the dictionary

3. **Observe Long-term Behavior**:
   - Over multiple evolution cycles, you'll see:
     - Property drift creating uniqueness
     - New relationships forming
     - Variant lineages developing

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Small**:
   - Begin with 4-5 core elements
   - Add a few key properties to each
   - Create basic interactions between them

2. **Use Meaningful Properties**:
   - Keep properties in the 0.0-1.0 range
   - Use consistent property names across related words
   - Consider what properties make sense for each category

3. **Set Reasonable Conditions**:
   - Make conditions achievable but not trivial
   - Use a combination of property checks
   - Consider context in your condition design

4. **Balance Evolution**:
   - Too fast: chaotic, unpredictable changes
   - Too slow: nothing interesting happens
   - Aim for noticeable but gradual evolution

5. **Regular Saving**:
   - Use the "Save All" button to persist your dictionary
   - Save after creating important words or interactions

## Next Steps

After getting familiar with the basic system:

1. **Connect to Elements**:
   - Link dictionary words to physical game elements
   - Have interactions in-game trigger dictionary interactions

2. **Expand Categories**:
   - Add "concept", "location", "entity" categories
   - Create hierarchies with parent-child relationships

3. **Complex Interactions**:
   - Create multi-step interaction chains
   - Design emergent properties that appear under special conditions

4. **Custom Visualization**:
   - Adjust visualization parameters for your specific content
   - Create specialized views for different word categories
