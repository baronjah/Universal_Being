## Choose Your Integration Method

### Option 1: Auto Diagnostics and Manual Integration (Recommended)

This approach diagnoses your scene structure and helps you integrate the system manually:

1. Add the scene_dumper.gd script to a temporary node in your scene
2. Run the scene to get a detailed analysis
3. Remove the temporary node
4. Follow the THING_CREATOR_LAYER0_INTEGRATION.md guide with the correct paths

This option is best when you want to understand what's happening and have full control.

### Option 2: Automatic Integration with Proxy Methods

This approach tries to automatically integrate the system:

1. Add thing_creator_auto_integrator.gd to a node in your scene
2. Run the scene - it will analyze the structure and create proxy methods
3. Check the console for status and any issues
4. Verify functionality with the console commands

This option is best when your menu structure is complex or you're unsure about paths.

### Option 3: Standalone Mode (Simplest)

This approach creates a completely independent UI:

1. Add thing_creator_standalone.gd to a node in your scene
2. Run the scene - it will create its own floating UI
3. Press T to toggle the UI

This option is best when you don't have a suitable menu system or want a separate UI.

## Integration Instructions

### OPTION 1: Auto Diagnostics and Manual Integration

1. Copy all the core files to their appropriate locations
2. Create a new Node in your layer_0.tscn scene
3. Attach scene_dumper.gd or menu_system_inspector.gd to it
4. Run the scene and check the console output
5. Note the paths to JSH console, view area, and main controller
6. Remove the diagnostics node
7. Follow the integration guide with the correct paths

### OPTION 2: Automatic Integration

1. Copy all the core files to their appropriate locations
2. Create a new Node in your layer_0.tscn scene
3. Attach thing_creator_auto_integrator.gd to it
4. Run the scene
5. Check the console for the integration report
6. Test functionality with console commands

### OPTION 3: Standalone Mode

1. Copy all the core files to their appropriate locations
2. Create a new Node in your layer_0.tscn scene
3. Attach thing_creator_standalone.gd to it
4. Run the scene
5. Press T to toggle the Thing Creator UI

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **File not found errors**
   - Make sure all Thing Creator files are in the correct locations
   - Check that paths in the code match your project structure

2. **JSH console not found**
   - Try to manually specify the path to your JSH console
   - Use the standalone mode which doesn't require JSH console

3. **Menu entries not appearing**
   - Check if your main console implements the required methods
   - Use the auto_integrator which adds proxy methods
   - Consider the standalone mode

4. **UI not displaying**
   - Verify your view area path is correct
   - Use the auto_integrator which can create a view area
   - Use the standalone mode which creates its own UI

## Testing Basic Functionality

After integration, test:

1. Creating a thing via JSH console:
   ```
   thing-help
   thing-create fire 0 1 0
   thing-list
   ```

2. Opening the Thing Creator UI through the menu

3. Creating a thing through the UI

## Advanced Integration

Once the basic integration is working, you can:

1. Connect the Thing Creator to your game's element system
2. Add custom properties to created things
3. Process interactions between things
4. Use the Thing Creator API in your game logic
