## Current Issues
1. Compatibility issues with Godot 4.4.1 (API changes)
2. Dictionary empty() function deprecated
3. Missing GridMesh class references
4. Type mismatches in parameter passing
5. Animation API changes
6. Performance issues with too many light sources
7. ZoneManager class resolution errors

## Development Focus
The primary focus should be on building the Akashic Records system integrated with the existing menu console, allowing for dynamic creation, evolution, and visualization of words/concepts as interactive entities in the game world.
