# Temperature System Update Notes

## Version 1.0 - Sound Integration

This update adds a comprehensive sound system to the temperature mechanics, creating a complete audio-visual experience for temperature states, transitions, and word transformations.

### New Features:

1. **Temperature Sound System**
   - Added ambient background sounds for each temperature state
   - Created transition effects between temperature states
   - Implemented word transformation sound effects
   - Added audio bus configuration for temperature sounds
   - Integrated volume controls and mute functionality

2. **Audio-Visual Synchronization**
   - Sound effects automatically sync with visual effects
   - Smooth transitions between ambient soundscapes
   - Word transformation audio tied to physical state changes
   - Audio characteristics match dimension temperature settings

3. **Audio Controls**
   - Added volume controls for all temperature sounds
   - Implemented mute toggle with M key
   - Created console commands for sound control
   - Added separate volume controls for ambient, transition, and transformation sounds

### System Integration:

- TemperatureSoundSystem connects with TemperatureSystem for state tracking
- Audio feedback connects with TemperatureWordEffects for transformation events
- Sound characteristics adapt based on dimension temperature settings
- Audio mixing optimized for immersive experience with other system sounds

### Console Commands:

```
temp_sound volume <value>
```
Sets the master volume for all temperature sounds (0.0-1.0).

```
temp_sound ambient <value>
```
Sets the volume for ambient temperature sounds.

```
temp_sound transition <value>
```
Sets the volume for temperature transition sounds.

```
temp_sound transform <value>
```
Sets the volume for word transformation sounds.

```
temp_sound play ambient <state>
```
Plays the ambient sound for a specific temperature state. 
Valid states: FROZEN, COLD, NORMAL, WARM, HOT, BOILING, PLASMA

```
temp_sound play transition <from_state> <to_state>
```
Plays the transition sound between two temperature states.

```
temp_sound play transform <type>
```
Plays a specific transformation sound effect.
Valid types: freeze, melt, evaporate, condense, ionize, deionize

```
temp_sound stop <ambient|transition|transform|all>
```
Stops the specified sound category, or all temperature sounds.

```
temp_sound current
```
Displays information about currently playing temperature sounds.

### Technical Implementation:

- Added AudioStreamPlayer nodes for different sound categories
- Implemented smooth volume transitions between ambient states
- Created audio bus structure with temperature-specific bus
- Added signal connections for temperature state changes and word transformations
- Optimized audio mixing for different dimension environments

### Usage Example:

1. Change to a cold dimension like Delta (-10Â°C)
2. Listen to the ice crystal ambient soundscape
3. Create words and hear freezing transformation sounds
4. Gradually increase temperature to experience the audio progression
5. Use console commands to experiment with different sound combinations

### Next Steps:

1. Create temperature-reactive music system
2. Implement spatial audio for word temperature effects
3. Add voice-controlled temperature changes
4. Develop dimension-specific musical themes
5. Create audio visualization based on temperature states
