# Temperature System for Notepad3D

The Temperature System is a dynamic environmental control mechanism that affects word behavior, appearance, and interactions in the Notepad3D environment. This system integrates with the 12-dimension cosmic cycle to provide dimension-specific temperature variations and transformative effects on words.

## Overview

The Temperature System adds a new layer of interaction to the word manifestation process. Temperature affects the physical state, behavior, and appearance of words, allowing for transformations between solid, liquid, gas, and plasma states. This creates new gameplay mechanics and enhances the connection between dimensions and word manifestation.

## Key Features

### Temperature States

Words can exist in various temperature states:

- **FROZEN** (Below 0°C): Words solidify into crystalline forms, move slowly, and have increased gravity.
- **COLD** (0-10°C): Words move sluggishly with light frost effects.
- **NORMAL** (10-30°C): Standard word behavior with default physics properties.
- **WARM** (30-50°C): Words become more energetic with subtle warm glows.
- **HOT** (50-100°C): Words begin to destabilize, move rapidly, and emit heat ripples.
- **BOILING** (100-1000°C): Words become highly unstable, constantly transforming, and emit intense heat.
- **PLASMA** (Above 1000°C): Words transcend their physical form, becoming pure energy with erratic movement.

### Word Transformations

Temperature changes can cause words to transform between different states:

1. **Freezing**: Words transition from normal to frozen state (below 0°C)
2. **Melting**: Frozen words return to normal state (above 5°C)
3. **Evaporation**: Words transition from normal to gaseous state (above 100°C)
4. **Condensation**: Gaseous words return to normal state (below 80°C)
5. **Ionization**: Words transition to plasma state (above 1000°C)
6. **De-ionization**: Plasma words return to gaseous state (below 1000°C)

Each transformation affects word appearance, physics, and behavior.

### Dimension-Specific Temperatures

Each of the 12 dimensions has its own base temperature:

- **Alpha**: 25°C (Normal room temperature)
- **Beta**: 10°C (Cool)
- **Gamma**: 40°C (Warm)
- **Delta**: -10°C (Frozen)
- **Epsilon**: 60°C (Hot)
- **Zeta**: 5°C (Cold)
- **Eta**: 90°C (Near boiling)
- **Theta**: 120°C (Boiling)
- **Iota**: -50°C (Deep freeze)
- **Kappa**: 1500°C (Plasma)
- **Lambda**: 35°C (Warm)
- **Mu**: 20°C (Mild)

Temperature integrates with the cosmic cycle, creating unique environmental conditions for each dimension.

### Visual Effects

The Temperature System includes comprehensive visual effects:

- **Environmental Effects**: Each temperature state affects the global environment with fog, lighting, color tints, and atmospheric effects.
- **Word Materials**: Words change appearance based on temperature (ice crystals, heat ripples, plasma glows).
- **Particle Systems**: Temperature-specific particle effects attach to words (frost, steam, plasma energy).
- **Physics Modifications**: Temperature affects word movement, gravity, and interactions.

### Sound Effects

The Temperature System features a rich audio experience:

- **Ambient Sounds**: Each temperature state has its own ambient background sound (ice crystals tinkling, water flowing, steam hissing, plasma humming).
- **Transition Sounds**: Smooth audio transitions when moving between temperature states.
- **Word Transformation Sounds**: Unique sound effects for each transformation type (freezing, melting, evaporating, etc.).
- **Audio Mixing**: Temperature sounds have their own audio bus for independent volume control.
- **Dimension Integration**: Sound characteristics change with each dimension's temperature.

### UI and Controls

- **Temperature UI**: Visual display showing current temperature, state, and effects.
- **Temperature Controls**: Manually adjust temperature with Up/Down arrow keys.
- **Toggle UI**: Press T to show/hide the temperature control panel.
- **Sound Toggle**: Press M to mute/unmute temperature sounds.

## Integration with Other Systems

The Temperature System integrates with:

1. **Turn Manager**: Changes temperature when dimensions change.
2. **Word Manifestation System**: Applies temperature effects to words.
3. **Divine Word Processor**: Word power affects temperature resilience.
4. **Realism Ratio**: Lower realism creates more extreme temperatures.
5. **Blink System**: Blinking momentarily intensifies temperature effects.
6. **Sound System**: Provides audio feedback for temperature states and transitions.

## Console Commands

The Temperature System adds several console commands:

- `temperature set <value>`: Sets the temperature to a specific value
- `temperature get`: Displays current temperature and state
- `temperature_visual describe`: Describes current visual effects
- `temp_effect list`: Lists all words and their temperature states
- `temp_effect history <word_id>`: Shows transformation history for a word
- `temp_effect transform <word_id> <form>`: Manually transform a word to a specific state
- `temp_integration dimension`: Shows current dimension temperature
- `temp_sound volume <value>`: Sets the master volume for temperature sounds
- `temp_sound play ambient <state>`: Plays ambient sound for a specific state
- `temp_sound play transform <type>`: Plays a transformation sound effect
- `temp_sound stop all`: Stops all temperature sound effects

## Technical Implementation

The Temperature System consists of five main components:

1. **TemperatureSystem**: Core system managing temperature values and states
2. **TemperatureVisualEffects**: Handles visual representation of temperature
3. **TemperatureWordEffects**: Manages word transformations and physical effects
4. **TemperatureSoundSystem**: Controls audio feedback for temperature states and changes
5. **TemperatureIntegration**: Connects temperature to all other systems
