# knowing word and what repeat and what will become a function in godot is like a hint

# to know what functions to follow to add anything if we limit amounts of data in 2d and 3d, as we later can have more than one file, code
# shader

# script node code name extension path file arm bridge, pipe, line and points like starts on sky
#

# we can call one node in many ways now too
# probably with my way in few ways in threads too and in turns and numbers 

# of many kind from 0 to 0000 and more 0010110 numbers
# limit is high

# thats all

# scenes, Scenes Scene scene
# bank class file script code node

# change of amounts and numbers and symbols and lenghts in programing is sacred, find symbols and 
# cross
# 40 years baby is like adventure on desert with me and tutorial for a game

# and you return from travel and upgrade in dream
# game continue too in a sense of planet and cosmos
# we have stars and planets kinda, we must move them too, and change them in scale and water too

# hard
# but we can do that too with noise

# one or two symbols appear too, it is not that hard for machine and human too
# we can clean fast and automate programing if we make new window in records
# are we in scenes?
# we can fit any file anywhere
# with records we make things, in scenes we make scene, in instruction we set number 0 from maybe null or -99 for lulz
#

# we can find the number and know the limit of size in width, even if i move it left and right
# size matter in limits of zoom at once and scroll and finger and finger in vr too, the same, connected
# but we have limits of windows sizes and spaces, we can always see test and imagine

# what i see in godot i can see as text mesh and key cap in keyboard anyway now
# window layer, distance, change animation amounts, threads, move change
# move repeat, how often how fast, time task queue, frequency and time as we check, do we split that code
# with files and nodes and datapoints maybe too?

# winth buttons in recods, arrange them in scenes, with layers each thing can be a button and shape
# like pixels on terminal and console that change and have limit of points and touch
# them move and have biomes that change like water too in 3d noise, if we touch

# touch of arrays of data, but how do we split with splitters? we split with words the words we split with amounts and splits too?
# array is numbers as key not strings and key and dictionary so we touch them in different way, dictionary can be like array with strings
# in one string of one array too, we back with numbers, arrange organise once in a while and project update, if we know how to move in paths

# morse code of max amounts to talk with aliens in symbols and hieroglyps of animations
