CLAUDE'S NOTES ON ELEMENTS_SHAPES_PROJECTION

Key Files:
- base_element.gd: Base class for all elements
- element_system.gd: System managing all elements
- elements.gd: Possibly a container or registry for elements
- fire_element.gd: Fire element implementation
- water_element.gd: Water element implementation
- wood_element.gd: Wood element implementation
- ash_element.gd: Ash element implementation

This folder contains the elemental system, with different element types that likely inherit from a base element class. All files have been recently modified (May 7), suggesting active development in this area.

The elements likely have different properties and behaviors, potentially interacting with each other (e.g., fire burning wood, water extinguishing fire).

Each element file is substantial in size, suggesting complex behaviors and properties for each element type.
