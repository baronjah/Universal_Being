## SCRIPT INVENTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCRIPT: base_element.gd
CLASS: None (Base class for elements)
EXTENDS: Node3D
CONNECTIONS:
  - IMPORTS: None
  - EXPORTS: Used by all element types (fire, water, wood, ash)
  - CALLS: Internal methods, file operations for archiving
  - CALLED BY: ElementManager for creation and management
FUNCTIONALITY: Base class for all elements in the system, providing core functionality for physics, evolution, and visualization.
INTEGRATION NOTES: Serves as the foundation for the element system, providing base functionality that specific elements can override and extend. Includes methods for archiving to the Akashic Records system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCRIPT: fire_element.gd
CLASS: FireElement
EXTENDS: base_element.gd
CONNECTIONS:
  - IMPORTS: None
  - EXPORTS: Used by ElementManager
  - CALLS: ElementResourceManager for resource management
  - CALLED BY: ElementManager for creation, processing physics and behavior
FUNCTIONALITY: Provides fire-specific behavior including heat, light emission, particle effects, and interaction with flammable materials.
INTEGRATION NOTES: Implements fire mechanics that can interact with other elements. Can connect to the resource management system for optimized rendering.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCRIPT: element_manager.gd
CLASS: ElementManager
EXTENDS: Node3D
CONNECTIONS:
  - IMPORTS: ElementResourceManager, various element scripts
  - EXPORTS: Used by universal system
  - CALLS: Element methods, ElementResourceManager
  - CALLED BY: Universal bridge for creation and management
FUNCTIONALITY: Manages the creation, processing, and lifecycle of all elements. Handles LOD (Level of Detail) optimization, performance monitoring, and resource management.
INTEGRATION NOTES: Acts as the gateway to the element system. Implements interfaces for scale management to integrate with larger universe systems. Provides methods for manifesting words as element patterns.
