# VR Quick Start Guide for Eden Space Game

This guide provides a quick overview of how to use the VR implementation with the Akashic Records system in Eden Space Game.

## Prerequisites

- Oculus Quest 2 headset with developer mode enabled
- Godot 4.4 installed with OpenXR plugin
- Eden Space Game project with the VR system files installed

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using the Test Scene

1. Open the project in Godot editor
2. Load the test scene at `res://code/gdscript/scenes/vr_test_scene.tscn`
3. Run the scene
4. Put on your VR headset
5. Use the controllers to interact with the elements

### Option 2: Integrating with Main Game

1. Open the main game scene
2. Add the VR integration node:
   ```gdscript
   var vr_integration = load("res://code/gdscript/scripts/Menu_Keyboard_Console/vr_integration.gd").new()
   vr_integration.name = "VRIntegration"
   add_child(vr_integration)
   ```
3. Run the game
4. Toggle VR mode by pressing F8
5. Put on your VR headset

## VR Controls

### Basic Controls

- **Left Trigger**: Interact with objects/elements
- **Right Trigger**: Select objects/elements
- **Left Grip**: Grab and move objects
- **Right Grip**: Toggle menu display
- **Left Primary Button (X)**: Scale transition up (zoom out)
- **Right Primary Button (A)**: Scale transition down (zoom in)

### Gestures

- **Pinch**: Moving controllers together to zoom in (smaller scale)
- **Spread**: Moving controllers apart to zoom out (larger scale)
- **Point and Draw**: Create new elements or dictionary entries

## Akashic Records in VR

The VR implementation visualizes the Akashic Records (Dynamic Dictionary) as 3D objects that you can interact with using your controllers.

### Dictionary Visualization

- **Dictionary Entries**: Shown as colorful spheres
- **Connections**: Represented by lines between related entries
- **Categories**: Different colors represent different categories

### Interaction

- **View Details**: Point at an entry and press trigger to view details
- **Create Connections**: Select two entries and perform a pinch gesture
- **Create Entries**: Use the virtual keyboard to create new entries
- **Delete Entries**: Select an entry and use the delete gesture

## Scale Transitions in VR

Eden Space Game features seamless transitions between different cosmic scales. In VR, these transitions are specially designed to be comfortable:

1. The camera remains stationary (world-centered approach)
2. The world scales and moves around you
3. Visual effects help indicate the scale change
4. Camera parameters adjust to the new scale

### Scale Levels

- **Universe**: Multiple galaxies view
- **Galaxy**: Stars within a galaxy
- **Star System**: Planets orbiting a star
- **Planet**: Surface of a planet
- **Element**: Individual elements and their interactions

## Element Interaction in VR

The element system allows physical interaction in VR:

1. Grab elements with the grip buttons
2. Throw elements with a flicking motion
3. Combine elements by bringing them together
4. Create new elements through interactions

### Basic Element Combinations

- **Fire + Wood** → Ash
- **Water + Fire** → Water (Fire extinguished)
- **Water + Ash** → Wood (Life from fertility)
- **Fire + Fire** → Larger Fire

## Performance Tips

- If experiencing performance issues, reduce the render scale in VR settings
- For better tracking, ensure good lighting in your physical space
- If motion sickness occurs, enable comfort mode in settings
- Teleport movement is recommended over continuous movement

## Troubleshooting

- **VR Not Initializing**: Make sure Oculus Quest 2 is connected and in developer mode
- **Controllers Not Detected**: Restart controllers or reconnect headset
- **Poor Performance**: Lower render scale and disable visual effects
- **Scale Transitions Uncomfortable**: Adjust transition speed in settings
