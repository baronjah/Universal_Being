# Akashic Records System Implementation

## Overview
The Akashic Records system is the foundation of Eden's dynamic data management, allowing complex relationships between concepts, elements, and game objects. It integrates with the space game's existing architecture to create a seamless experience from cosmic scales down to elemental interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Dynamic Dictionary
The `DynamicDictionary` class serves as a hierarchical database of words/concepts, handling:
- Storage of base words (elements, cosmic objects, etc.)
- Hierarchical relationships between words
- Properties and behaviors of each word
- Splitting large dictionaries into separate files
- Loading and unloading dictionary data as needed

### 2. Word Entry
The `WordEntry` class represents individual words in the dictionary:
- Stores properties, states, and interactions
- Manages parent-child relationships
- Handles serialization and deserialization
- Provides methods for property and state manipulation

### 3. Dictionary Splitter
The `DictionarySplitter` utility manages the dictionary file structure:
- Analyzes dictionaries for splitting candidates
- Creates separate dictionary files for complex words
- Manages references between dictionary files
- Optimizes memory usage by splitting large dictionaries

### 4. Interaction Engine
The `InteractionEngine` processes interactions between words:
- Evaluates interaction rules between word types
- Processes state changes and transformations
- Applies effects of interactions to entities
- Maintains interaction history

### 5. Zone Manager
The `ZoneManager` organizes spatial data in the game world:
- Divides the world into manageable zones
- Splits zones when they become too complex
- Manages entity distribution across zones
- Optimizes memory usage by loading/unloading zones

### 6. Akashic Records Manager
The `AkashicRecordsManager` coordinates all subsystems:
- Initializes and manages subsystems
- Provides a unified API for dictionary and zone operations
- Handles cross-system interactions
- Manages serialization and persistence

### 7. Universe Dictionary Bridge
The `UniverseDictionaryBridge` connects the Akashic Records to the space game:
- Maps cosmic objects to dictionary entities
- Propagates updates between systems
- Handles scale-specific operations
- Provides interaction interface for cosmic objects

## Integration with Space Game

### Dictionary Integration
The Dynamic Dictionary stores definitions for:
1. **Cosmic Object Types** - galaxies, stars, planets
2. **Scale Levels** - universe, galaxy, star_system, planet, element
3. **Elements** - fire, water, wood, ash
4. **Properties** - defining characteristics of each type

Each dictionary entry contains:
- Basic identification (ID, category, parent)
- Properties defining behavior
- States that can change based on conditions
- Interaction rules with other types

### Zone System Integration
The Zone Manager organizes:
1. **Spatial Partitioning** - dividing the universe into manageable chunks
2. **Entity Distribution** - placing entities in appropriate zones
3. **Dynamic Splitting** - creating new zones when complexity increases
4. **Optimized Loading** - only loading zones that are currently needed

### Scale Transitions
The bridge between systems facilitates scale transitions:
1. **Scale Factors** - defining relationships between different scales
2. **Resource Management** - adjusting resource limits based on scale
3. **Entity Mapping** - connecting cosmic objects to dictionary entities
4. **Interaction Translation** - allowing cross-scale interactions

## Data Flow

1. **Creation Flow**:
   * Cosmic objects are created in the space game
   * Bridge registers them as entities in zones
   * Words in dictionary define their behavior
   * Split operations occur when complexity increases

2. **Interaction Flow**:
   * Interactions are initiated between cosmic objects
   * Bridge translates to dictionary word interactions
   * Interaction engine processes the rules
   * Results are applied to entities
   * Changes propagate back to cosmic objects

3. **Scale Transition Flow**:
   * Scale changes in the universe controller
   * Dictionary provides scale-specific properties
   * Zone manager adjusts active zones
   * Resource manager updates limits
   * Bridge propagates changes to both systems

## Implementation Example

### Registering a Star System

```gdscript
# In UniverseController
var star_data = {
    "star_type": StarSystem.StarType.G_TYPE,
    "temperature": 5800,
    "size": 1.0,
    "color": Color(1.0, 1.0, 0.8)
}

var star_id = "star_" + str(system_seed)
var star_position = Vector3(galaxy_pos.x + local_x, galaxy_pos.y + local_y, galaxy_pos.z + local_z)

# Bridge handles registration with Akashic Records
var entity_id = universe_dictionary_bridge.register_cosmic_object(
    star_id,
    "star",
    star_position,
    star_data
)
```

### Processing an Interaction

```gdscript
# When a star and planet interact
func process_star_planet_interaction(star_id, planet_id):
    # Bridge handles the interaction through Akashic Records
    var result = universe_dictionary_bridge.process_cosmic_interaction(star_id, planet_id)
    
    if result.success:
        # Apply game-specific effects based on the interaction result
        if result.result == "heat_transfer":
            # Update planet temperature
            var planet = get_planet(planet_id)
            planet.increase_temperature(result.data.heat_amount)
        elif result.result == "radiation_effect":
            # Apply radiation to planet
            var planet = get_planet(planet_id)
            planet.apply_radiation(result.data.radiation_level)
```
