# Eden Space Game - Overview

## Core Concept
Eden Space Game combines cosmic scale exploration with elemental interactions, allowing players to:
1. Explore a procedural universe with galaxies, stars, and planets
2. Navigate from universe level down to elemental scale
3. Interact with elemental systems that simulate physics and transformations
4. Build and pilot spaceships between cosmic bodies
5. Construct mechas for planetary exploration

## Scale Levels
The game seamlessly transitions between multiple scale levels:

1. **Universe Scale**
   - View of multiple galaxies in space
   - Navigate between galaxy clusters
   - Each galaxy has unique properties and element distributions

2. **Galaxy Scale**
   - Stars visible within a galaxy
   - Nebulae and cosmic phenomena
   - Navigation between star systems

3. **Star System Scale**
   - Planets orbiting stars
   - Asteroid belts and space phenomena
   - Planetary orbit visualization

4. **Planet Scale**
   - Planetary surface features
   - Atmospheric and environmental conditions
   - Landing sites and points of interest

5. **Element Scale**
   - Individual elements (fire, water, wood, ash)
   - Particle interactions and transformations
   - Physics simulation of elemental behaviors
