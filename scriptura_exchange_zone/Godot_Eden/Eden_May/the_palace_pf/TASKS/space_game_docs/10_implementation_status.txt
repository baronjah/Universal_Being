## Technical Information

The implemented systems are located in the following directories:
- `/code/gdscript/scripts/Galaxy_Star_Planet/` - Space game components
- `/code/gdscript/scripts/universe_particles_physics/` - Scale and resource management
- `/code/gdscript/scripts/elements_shapes_projection/` - Element system

Main classes:
- `GalaxyData` - Galaxy representation and storage
- `StarSystem` - Complete star system with properties
- `StarSystemGenerator` - Creates star systems procedurally
- `PlanetSystem` - Planetary system with properties and resources
- `SpaceCameraController` - Camera control for space navigation
- `SpaceSelectionSystem` - Object selection handling

## Integration Plan
The next phase is to integrate these systems with the existing element system, allowing seamless transitions from cosmic scale to element interaction. This will involve:

1. Setting up the universe_controller.gd to manage scale transitions
2. Implementing proper LOD (Level of Detail) systems for all objects
3. Creating transition effects between scales
4. Building UI for space navigation and scale indication
