# Eden Space Game: Test Evolution Visualizer Scene

## Overview
The Test Evolution Visualizer is a dedicated scene for testing and demonstrating the integration between the Evolution Manager and Frequency Visualizer systems. This scene provides a controlled environment to visualize how dictionary entries evolve over time and how they are represented visually in 3D space.

## Key Components

### Test Evolution Scene Script
The `test_evolution_scene.gd` script manages the test environment, creating mock data and connecting the Evolution Manager and Frequency Visualizer systems:

- Creates a simplified `AkashicRecordsStub` and `WordEntryStub` for testing
- Populates the system with sample words related to cosmic and energetic concepts
- Provides UI controls for adjusting evolution parameters in real-time
- Displays statistics about the evolution process
- Shows detailed information about selected words
- Allows manual triggering of evolution cycles for testing

### Evolution Management
The scene directly connects to the core Evolution Manager system:

- Controls automatic evolution cycles
- Adjusts evolution parameters (interval, rate, variant probability)
- Tracks statistics like word count, evolution cycles, and variants generated
- Demonstrates property drift mechanics
- Shows variant generation based on usage patterns

### Visualization Features
The scene demonstrates all visualization capabilities:

- Shows different layout algorithms (radial, spiral, cluster)
- Visualizes words as interactive 3D nodes
- Displays relationships between parent words and variants
- Updates visualization in real-time as words evolve
- Allows direct interaction with visualized words

## Usage Instructions

1. **Adding Words**: Click the "Add Random Word" button to add new words with random properties.

2. **Evolution Control**:
   - Toggle "Auto Evolution" to enable/disable automatic evolution cycles
   - Adjust "Evolution Interval" to control how frequently cycles occur
   - Adjust "Evolution Rate" to control how rapidly properties drift

3. **Visualization Options**:
   - Change the "Layout Type" dropdown to switch between different visualization patterns
   - Select words in the visualization to view detailed information

4. **Manual Testing**:
   - Click "Trigger Evolution Cycle" to manually initiate an evolution cycle
   - Watch the statistics panel to track evolution progress

## Technical Implementation

The test scene creates a self-contained environment that doesn't depend on the full Akashic Records implementation, making it ideal for isolated testing. It uses stubs that mimic the core functionality:

```gdscript
# Simple stub class for AkashicRecords to use in testing
class AkashicRecordsStub:
    var words = []
    var next_id = 0
    
    func create_word(text, properties={}):
        var word = WordEntryStub.new(next_id, text, properties)
        next_id += 1
        words.append(word)
        return word
```

This approach allows testing of the Evolution Manager and Frequency Visualizer without the complexity of the full Akashic Records system.

## Integration Notes

This test scene serves as a prototype for how these systems will integrate with the full game:

1. The Evolution Manager will connect to the actual Akashic Records system
2. The Frequency Visualizer will be integrated with the VR system for immersive exploration
3. The UI will be replaced with VR-friendly controls in the final implementation

The test scene is designed to verify that the core mechanics work as expected before integrating with the more complex full game systems.

## Performance Considerations

The test scene limits visualization to 50 words maximum (configurable) to maintain good performance. In the full implementation, additional optimization techniques will be needed:

- Level-of-detail adjustments for distant words
- Frustum culling for words outside the view
- Instance pooling for word visualizations
- Throttled updates during heavy evolution cycles

## Next Steps

After testing with this scene, the next steps will be:

1. Integrate the Evolution Manager with the full Akashic Records system
2. Connect the Frequency Visualizer to the VR interaction system
3. Implement proper serialization to save/load evolution state
4. Create VR-friendly UI for controlling evolution parameters
5. Test with larger dictionaries to evaluate performance
