   - VR Akashic Interface (vr_akashic_interface.gd): 3D visualization of dictionary
   - VR Element Interaction (vr_element_interaction.gd): Physics-based VR interactions

2. **Integration Files**
   - VR Integration (vr_integration.gd): Connects VR to the main game
   - VR Helper (vr_helper.gd): Utility functions for VR integration
   - Main Integration Patch: Instructions for adding VR to main.gd

3. **Test Environment**
   - VR Test Scene (vr_test_scene.gd): Standalone scene for testing VR
   - Test Instructions: Guide for setting up and running tests

4. **Documentation**
   - VR Implementation (14_vr_implementation.txt): Comprehensive documentation
   - VR Integration Plan (15_vr_integration_plan.txt): Detailed integration steps
   - VR Implementation Summary (16_vr_implementation_summary.txt): Overview

## Long-term Vision

Looking beyond the immediate implementation, the long-term vision for VR in Eden Space Game includes:

1. **Multiplayer VR Experience**: Allow multiple users to explore and interact in the same space
2. **Procedural Universe in VR**: Seamlessly generate and explore infinite procedural content
3. **AI-Driven Interactions**: Use AI to create more dynamic and realistic element interactions
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Expand beyond Quest 2 to other VR platforms
5. **Advanced Physics Simulation**: Implement more realistic element physics for deeper interactions

By following this development roadmap, the Eden Space Game will offer a unique and immersive VR experience that allows players to explore the universe and interact with the Akashic Records in a natural and intuitive way.
