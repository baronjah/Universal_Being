# 🌱 Phase 1: Universal Entity Foundation 

## 📋 Overview

The Universal Entity represents our "zero point" concept - the foundational element that can transform into anything in the JSH Ethereal Engine. This phase focuses on building the core UniversalEntity class with transformation, evolution, and basic visualization capabilities.

## 🎯 Goals

- Create a robust UniversalEntity base class
- Implement word-to-property conversion
- Develop a visual representation system
- Build transformation and evolution mechanics

- [ ] Add relationship tracking (parent/child entities)
- [ ] Setup reality context properties

### 📌 Task 2: Word-to-Property Conversion
- [ ] Implement word analysis algorithm
- [ ] Create property extraction logic
- [ ] Build form determination system
- [ ] Add property scaling mechanism

### 📌 Task 3: Visual Representation System
- [ ] Create form-specific visual generators
- [ ] Implement property-to-visual mapping

### Base Class Structure

```gdscript
class_name UniversalEntity
extends Node3D

# Entity state
var entity_type = "undefined"
var manifestation_level = 0.0  # 0.0 = unmanifested, 1.0 = fully manifested
var current_form = "seed"
var properties = {}
var source_word = ""

# Entity relationships
var parent_entity = null
var child_entities = []
var connected_entities = []

# Reality context
var reality_context = "physical"
var reality_influence = 1.0

# Core methods
func manifest_from_word(word: String, influence: float = 1.0):
    # Initialize entity from word
    pass
    
func transform_to(new_form: String, transformation_speed: float = 1.0):
    # Transform entity to new form
    pass
    
func evolve(evolution_factor: float = 0.1):
    # Evolve entity to higher manifestation level
    pass

# Helper methods
func word_to_properties(word: String) -> Dictionary:
    # Convert word to entity properties
    pass
    
func determine_initial_form(word: String) -> String:
    # Determine initial form based on word properties
    pass
    
func update_visual_representation():
    # Update visual based on current form and properties
    pass

# Signals
signal entity_created(entity)
signal entity_transformed(entity, old_form, new_form)
signal entity_evolved(entity, new_level)
```

### Word Analysis Implementation

The `word_to_properties` function will:
1. Analyze character composition
2. Extract semantic meaning where possible
3. Generate properties like:
   - Element affinity (fire, water, earth, air, void)
   - Complexity
   - Fluidity
   - Energy
   - Coherence
   - Resonance

### Visual Representations

Initial forms will include:
- `seed`: Small spherical entity (starting point)
- `flame`: Animated fire-like particles
- `droplet`: Transparent blue teardrop shape
- `pebble`: Textured rock-like form
- `wisp`: Ethereal, semi-transparent cloud
- `flow`: Flowing ribbon-like structure
- `crystal`: Geometric crystalline formation

Each form will have property-based variations affecting:
- Size
- Color
- Texture
- Animation speed
- Emission intensity

### Transformation Effect

When transforming between forms:
1. Apply scaling effect (grow then shrink)
2. Enable emission during transition
3. Particle effect at transformation point
4. Sound effect (optional)
5. Replace mesh/material with new form
6. Apply property-based modifications

## 🔄 Integration Points

- UniversalEntity will initially be a standalone class
- Future phases will connect it to:
  - Registry system (Phase 3)
  - Reality contexts (Phase 2)
  - Word manifestation (Phase 4)
  - Guardian system (Phase 5)

## 🔍 Testing Plan

1. Create test scene with UniversalEntity instances
2. Test word manifestation with various inputs
3. Verify visual representation accuracy
4. Test transformation between forms
5. Validate evolution mechanics
6. Verify signal emission

## 📝 Notes & References

- UniversalEntity should remain lightweight and focused
- Visual components should be modular and replaceable
- Property system should be extensible for future enhancements
- Transformation system should support future animation enhancements
