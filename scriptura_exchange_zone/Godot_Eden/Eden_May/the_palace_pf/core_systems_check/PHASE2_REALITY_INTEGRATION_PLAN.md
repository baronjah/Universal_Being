### Reality Context Enhancement

```gdscript
# Add to UniversalEntity class

# Reality properties
var reality_context = "physical"  # Current primary reality
var reality_influence = 1.0       # Influence of current reality (0.0-1.0)
var reality_blend = {}            # Influence of secondary realities

# Reality shifting
func shift_reality_context(new_reality: String, shift_speed: float = 1.0):
    var old_reality = reality_context
    
    # Store old reality in blend with reduced influence
    if not reality_blend.has(old_reality):
        reality_blend[old_reality] = 0.0
    reality_blend[old_reality] = 0.3  # Residual influence
    
    # Set new primary reality
    reality_context = new_reality
    
    # Start transition effect
    var tween = create_tween()
    tween.tween_property(self, "reality_influence", 0.0, 1.0 / shift_speed)
    tween.tween_callback(func(): 
        update_visual_for_reality()
        reality_influence = 0.0
    )
    tween.tween_property(self, "reality_influence", 1.0, 1.0 / shift_speed)
    
    emit_signal("reality_shifted", self, old_reality, new_reality)
    return self

# Reality influence management
func calculate_effective_properties() -> Dictionary:
    var effective_props = properties.duplicate(true)
    
    # Apply primary reality influence
    apply_reality_modifiers(effective_props, reality_context, reality_influence)
    
    # Apply secondary reality influences
    for secondary_reality in reality_blend:
        if reality_blend[secondary_reality] > 0.01:
            apply_reality_modifiers(effective_props, secondary_reality, reality_blend[secondary_reality])
    
    return effective_props

# Reality-specific modifiers
func apply_reality_modifiers(props: Dictionary, reality: String, influence: float):
    match reality:
        "physical":
            # Physical reality emphasizes material properties
            if props.has("mass"):
                props["mass"] *= 1.0 + (0.5 * influence)
            if props.has("tangibility"):
                props["tangibility"] *= 1.0 + (0.3 * influence)
                
        "digital":
            # Digital reality emphasizes pattern and structure
            if props.has("complexity"):
                props["complexity"] *= 1.0 + (0.5 * influence)
            if props.has("order"):
                props["order"] *= 1.0 + (0.4 * influence)
                
        "astral":
            # Astral reality emphasizes consciousness and energy
            if props.has("consciousness"):
                props["consciousness"] *= 1.0 + (0.7 * influence)
            if props.has("energy"):
                props["energy"] *= 1.0 + (0.5 * influence)
```

### Reality Transition Effects

The reality transition system will:
1. Gradually reduce influence of current reality
2. Apply transition effects (shader effects, particles)
3. Perform property adjustments based on reality contexts
4. Gradually increase influence of new reality

This creates smooth, visually interesting transitions between realities while maintaining entity continuity.

### Reality-Specific Visualization

```gdscript
func update_visual_for_reality():
    var visual_node = get_node_or_null("VisualRepresentation")
    if not visual_node:
        return
        
    # Apply reality-specific visual effects
    for child in visual_node.get_children():
        if child is MeshInstance3D:
            var material = child.material_override
            if not material:
                continue
                
            # Base material adjustments from effective properties
            var effective_props = calculate_effective_properties()
            
            # Apply reality-specific effects
            match reality_context:
                "physical":
                    # Physical reality: solid, tangible appearance
                    material.albedo_color = material.albedo_color.lerp(Color(0.2, 0.6, 1.0), reality_influence * 0.3)
                    material.roughness = lerp(material.roughness, 0.7, reality_influence * 0.5)
                    material.metallic = lerp(material.metallic, 0.1, reality_influence * 0.5)
                    if material.has_method("set_feature"):
                        material.set_feature(BaseMaterial3D.FEATURE_EMISSION, false)
                    
                "digital":
                    # Digital reality: glowing, patterned appearance
                    material.albedo_color = material.albedo_color.lerp(Color(0.1, 0.8, 0.2), reality_influence * 0.3)
                    material.roughness = lerp(material.roughness, 0.3, reality_influence * 0.5)
                    material.metallic = lerp(material.metallic, 0.8, reality_influence * 0.5)
                    if material.has_method("set_feature"):
                        material.set_feature(BaseMaterial3D.FEATURE_EMISSION, true)
                        material.emission = material.albedo_color.darkened(0.5)
                        material.emission_energy = 0.3 * reality_influence
                    
                "astral":
                    # Astral reality: ethereal, luminous appearance
                    material.albedo_color = material.albedo_color.lerp(Color(0.8, 0.3, 0.8), reality_influence * 0.3)
                    material.roughness = lerp(material.roughness, 0.1, reality_influence * 0.5)
                    material.metallic = lerp(material.metallic, 0.2, reality_influence * 0.5)
                    if material.has_method("set_feature"):
                        material.set_feature(BaseMaterial3D.FEATURE_EMISSION, true)
                        material.emission = material.albedo_color
                        material.emission_energy = 0.6 * reality_influence
                
            # Add secondary reality influences for blended appearances
            for secondary_reality in reality_blend:
                if reality_blend[secondary_reality] > 0.01:
                    apply_secondary_reality_visual(material, secondary_reality, reality_blend[secondary_reality])
```

### Reality Blend System

The reality blend system allows entities to exist partially in multiple realities simultaneously:
- Each reality contributes a portion of influence
- Properties are calculated based on blended influences
- Visual representation shows aspects of all influencing realities
- Behavior responds to dominant reality while incorporating secondary influences

## 🔄 Integration Points

- UniversalEntity will be enhanced with reality-aware methods
- Integration with the main reality system includes:
  - Reality shifting commands
  - Reality transition effects
  - Reality-specific behavior
  - Reality context awareness

## 🔍 Testing Plan

1. Create test scene with multiple reality contexts
2. Test entity shifting between realities
3. Verify visual changes during transitions
4. Test behavior changes in different realities
5. Validate blended reality effects
6. Test reality signals and events

## 📝 Notes & References

- Reality effects should be visually distinct but thematically coherent
- Transition effects should be smooth and reversible
- Reality influence system should support future expansion to new realities
- Secondary reality influences create "blend zones" for interesting effects
- Reality-specific behaviors should respect the core entity properties while adding context-specific variations
