# JSH Time Progression System

The JSH Time Progression System creates a dynamic time-based gameplay experience where player movement advances time, stories evolve over time, and players can experience dreams, memories, and telepathic connections throughout their journey in the world of words.

## Overview

The Time Progression System fundamentally changes how players interact with the JSH Ethereal Engine by:

1. Tying time advancement to player movement
2. Creating an evolving story structure that changes over time
3. Generating memories and dreams during gameplay
4. Enabling telepathic connections between memories
5. Supporting time stream navigation and time control
6. Creating animations that are triggered by movement
7. Coupling different realities with different time flow rates

This system transforms the experience from a static exploration into a dynamic narrative where words evolve, stories unfold, and time itself becomes a dimension to navigate and control.

## Time-Based Gameplay

### Story Evolution

The story evolves through eight distinct segments as time advances:

1. **Awakening**: Initial state of discovery
2. **Exploration**: Learning about the world
3. **Connection**: Forming relationships between concepts
4. **Transformation**: Words evolving into new forms
5. **Conflict**: Tensions between opposing concepts
6. **Resolution**: Harmonizing conflicting elements
7. **Transcendence**: Moving beyond initial limitations
8. **Rebirth**: Cycle begins anew

Each story segment has unique effects on the world:
- New thematic words appear
- Reality states change
- Zone properties adjust
- Words connect or evolve
- Opposing forces emerge and resolve

### Memory System

As the player moves through the world, memories are created:

1. **Memory Formation**: Created based on current scene
2. **Memory Content**: Contains information about words, zones, and reality
3. **Memory Connections**: Can form telepathic connections to other memories
4. **Dream Links**: Memories can connect to dreams

These memories form a personal history of the player's journey through the world of words.

### Dream System

Players can enter dream states with unique properties:

1. **Dream Navigation**: Special movement mode with dream-like physics
2. **Dream Time**: Time flows differently in dreams
3. **Dream Connections**: Dreams can connect to memories
4. **Dream Content**: Generated based on story arc and connected memories

Dreams provide an alternative perspective on the world and can reveal connections between concepts that aren't visible in waking reality.

### Time Control

Players have several ways to control time:

1. **Movement**: Simply moving advances time
2. **Time Stream Mode**: Special movement mode for rapid time travel
3. **Time Direction**: Can move forward or backward in time
4. **Time Dilation**: Different zones and realities have different time flow rates
5. **Dream Time**: Time flows differently in dream states

## Movement Modes

The extended player controller supports six movement modes:

1. **Walking**: Standard physical movement
2. **Flying**: Aerial movement, consumes energy
3. **Spectator**: No-clip ghost mode for observation
4. **Word Surfing**: Follow connections between words
5. **Dream Navigation**: Special movement in dream state
6. **Time Stream**: Move through time as a dimension

These movement modes interact with the time system in different ways:
- Walking advances time based on distance moved
- Flying accelerates time slightly
- Time Stream allows rapid movement through time
- Dream Navigation slows time progression

## Time Effects on Words

The passage of time affects words in several ways:

1. **Evolution**: Words evolve as time passes
2. **Animation**: Movement near words triggers animations
3. **Connections**: Time can strengthen connections between words
4. **Creation**: New words can manifest as time advances
5. **Destruction**: Words may fade away over time

## Animation System

Animations are triggered by player movement and time advancement:

1. **Pulse**: Words pulse when player moves near them
2. **Move Away**: Words shift position at high speeds
3. **Rotate**: Words rotate during climax story segments
4. **Scale Up**: Words grow during rising action
5. **Scale Down**: Words shrink during falling action

## Integration with Other Systems

The Time Progression System integrates with all other JSH systems:

1. **Zone Scale System**: Time flows differently across scales
2. **Reality Shifting**: Each reality has unique time properties
3. **Word Seed Evolution**: Time drives word evolution
4. **Game Controller**: Time affects scene generation
5. **Anime Style**: Animations are time-dependent

## Example Usage

Control time flow with movement:
```
# Moving advances time naturally
player_controller.calculate_movement(delta)

# Enter time stream for direct time control
player_controller.toggle_time_stream()

# Move forward in time (in time stream mode)
# Press W to advance time, S to rewind
```

Create and access memories:
```
# Create a new memory
var memory_id = time_progression_system.create_memory()

# Get all memory fragments
var memories = time_progression_system.get_memory_fragments()
```

Enter and exit dream states:
```
# Enter dream state
player_controller.enter_dream_state()

# Navigate in dreams (special physics)
# Movement controls work differently

# Exit dream state
player_controller.exit_dream_state()
```

Create story events based on time:
```
# Check current story segment
var segment = time_progression_system.get_current_story_segment()

# Get current story arc
var arc = time_progression_system.get_current_story_arc()

# Get story evolution points
var points = time_progression_system.get_story_evolution_points()
```

## Advanced Concepts

### Telepathic Connections

Memories can form telepathic connections to other memories, creating a web of associations that reflects the player's journey. These connections:

1. Form randomly between related memories
2. Strengthen over time with repeated exposure
3. Can be revealed in dreams
4. Create a personal history for the player

### Time Zones

Different areas of the world can have different time properties:

1. **Present Zone**: Standard time flow
2. **Past Zone**: Slower time, more stability
3. **Future Zone**: Accelerated time, faster evolution
4. **Eternal Zone**: Special quantum-scale zone outside of time
5. **Dream Zone**: Non-linear time with memory connections

### Story Intensity

The story has a dynamic intensity that affects the world:

1. **Beginning**: Low intensity, slow evolution
2. **Rising Action**: Increasing intensity, growing evolution rate
3. **Climax**: Maximum intensity, rapid changes
4. **Falling Action**: Decreasing intensity, stabilization
5. **Resolution**: Low intensity, preparation for new cycle

## Technical Notes

- Time advancement is tightly coupled with player movement
- Story evolution occurs at specific thresholds of accumulated time
- Memories are created periodically as time advances
- Dreams connect to recent memories with probabilistic logic
- The story follows a classic narrative arc that repeats cyclically
- Animations are triggered based on proximity, speed, and story arc
