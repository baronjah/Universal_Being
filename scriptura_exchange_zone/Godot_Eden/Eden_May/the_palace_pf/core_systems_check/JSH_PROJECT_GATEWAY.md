# JSH Ethereal Engine - Project Gateway

## Project Location

The JSH Ethereal Engine project has been moved to the Godot project folder. All development work should now be performed there.

## Project Directories

### Main Project Location
- **Godot Project**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/`
- This is the primary location where all project files, documentation, and code should be organized.

### Key Development Directories
- **Implementation Code**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/code/gdscript/scripts/`
- **Documentation**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/code_explained/`
- **Experimental Area**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/code/gdscript/scripts/scribbles_blueprints_testing/`
- **Scenes**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/code/gdscript/scenes/`

### WSL Integration
- **WSL Location**: `/home/kamisama/`
- Contains additional resources and integration points for the project.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation has been organized according to the following structure:

1. **Main Documentation**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/code_explained/`
   - Organized by subsystem (core, entity, word, spatial, etc.)
   - Contains detailed implementation documentation

2. **Implementation Code**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/code/`
   - Contains the actual Godot implementation code
   - Organized by language (GDScript, C#)

3. **Zero Point Entity Implementation**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/zero_point_entity/`
   - Contains the implementation details for the Zero Point Entity system

4. **Project Planning**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/space_game_docs/`
   - Contains project planning documents and implementation guides

## Getting Started

To work on the JSH Ethereal Engine:

1. Navigate to the main Godot project:
   ```bash
   cd "/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/"
   ```

2. Refer to the project README for setup instructions:
   ```bash
   cat "/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/README.md"
   ```

3. Review the implementation details in the code_explained directory:
   ```bash
   ls -la "/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/code_explained/"
   ```

## Important Notes

1. **Legacy Files**: Some documentation files may still exist in `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/`. These are being migrated to the main project location.

2. **Documentation Consistency**: All new documentation should be added to the Godot project structure.

3. **Cross-Environment References**: The project uses both Windows paths (`C:\Users\Percision 15\Godot_Eden\Eden_May\`) and WSL paths (`/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Godot_Eden/Eden_May/`).

## Navigation Tools

For easier navigation between environments, refer to the navigation script:
```bash
/home/kamisama/goto_jsh_project.sh
```
