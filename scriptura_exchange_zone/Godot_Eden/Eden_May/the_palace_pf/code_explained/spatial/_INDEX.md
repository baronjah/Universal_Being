# Spatial System Documentation

## Overview
The Spatial System provides comprehensive spatial management for the JSH Ethereal Engine. It organizes entities in 3D space, manages zones and areas, handles spatial queries, and optimizes performance through spatial partitioning. This system forms the foundation for all spatial operations and enables entity placement, movement, and interaction within the virtual world.

## Key Components

### Spatial Management
- [JSHSpatialManager](JSHSpatialManager.md) - Core spatial management system
- Handles entity positioning, zone creation, and spatial queries

### Spatial Partitioning
- [JSHSpatialGrid](JSHSpatialGrid.md) - Grid-based partitioning for entities
- [JSHOctree](JSHOctree.md) - Octree-based partitioning for zones
- Optimizes spatial queries and collision detection

### Spatial Interface
- [JSHSpatialInterface](JSHSpatialInterface.md) - Interface for spatial operations
- Provides standardized methods for interacting with the spatial system

### Command System
- [JSHSpatialCommands](JSHSpatialCommands.md) - Console commands for spatial operations
- Allows for runtime manipulation of spatial components

## Zone System

The Spatial System implements a hierarchical zone structure:

### Zone Features
- **3D Bounds**: Each zone has a defined 3D volume
- **Hierarchy**: Zones can have parent-child relationships
- **Dynamic Loading**: Zones can load/unload based on proximity
- **Entity Containment**: Zones track which entities are within them
- **Properties**: Zones can have custom gameplay properties

### Zone Types
- **Root Zones**: Top-level zones with no parent
- **Sub-Zones**: Child zones contained within parent zones
- **Transition Zones**: Zones with defined connections to other zones
- **Special Zones**: Zones with unique properties or behaviors

## Spatial Queries

The system provides efficient spatial querying capabilities:

### Entity Queries
- Finding entities within a radius
- Getting entities within a bounding box
- Finding the nearest entity to a position
- Querying entities by type, tag, and custom criteria

### Zone Queries
- Finding zones containing a point
- Getting zones that overlap with a radius
- Finding zones that intersect with a bounding box
- Determining zone containment and overlap

## Position Management

The system handles entity positioning and movement:

### Position Operations
- Setting entity positions
- Moving entities with zone transition handling
- Tracking entity movements
- Calculating distances and directions

### Coordinate Systems
- Global world coordinates
- Zone-relative coordinates
- Grid coordinates for partitioning

## Spatial Partitioning

Two complementary approaches are used for spatial optimization:

### Grid-Based Partitioning (JSHSpatialGrid)
- Divides world into uniform grid cells
- Provides O(1) access to entities by location
- Optimized for dense entity distributions
- Used primarily for entity queries

### Octree-Based Partitioning (JSHOctree)
- Hierarchical space subdivision
- Adaptive to spatial distribution
- Efficient for large, sparse worlds
- Used primarily for zone management

## Entity Culling

The system optimizes rendering through entity culling:

### Culling Methods
- Distance-based culling
- Frustum culling with camera
- Zone-based culling
- Priority-based culling for important entities

## Integration Points

The Spatial System integrates with several other components:

- **Entity System**: Positions and organizes entities in space
- **Word System**: Places manifested entities in appropriate zones
- **Visualization System**: Provides spatial information for rendering
- **Physics System**: Supplies spatial data for collision detection
- **Event System**: Triggers events based on spatial conditions

## Usage Examples

```gdscript
# Get the spatial manager
var spatial_manager = JSHSpatialManager.get_instance()

# Create a new zone
spatial_manager.create_zone("forest", {
    "name": "Forest",
    "bounds": {
        "min_x": -1000, "max_x": 1000,
        "min_y": 0, "max_y": 500,
        "min_z": -1000, "max_z": 1000
    }
})

# Position an entity
spatial_manager.set_entity_position(entity_id, Vector3(100, 0, 200))

# Find nearby entities
var position = Vector3(100, 0, 200)
var radius = 50
var nearby_entities = spatial_manager.get_entities_in_radius(position, radius)

# Get zones at a position
var zones = spatial_manager.get_zones_containing_point(position)
```
