# Entity System Documentation

## Overview
The Entity System is a core component of the JSH Ethereal Engine that manages the creation, evolution, transformation, and interaction of entities. Entities are the fundamental objects in the system, representing everything from simple elemental forms to complex evolved constructs.

## Key Components

### Universal Entity
- [JSHUniversalEntity](JSHUniversalEntity.md) - The base entity class that provides core entity functionality
- [CoreUniversalEntity](../core/CoreUniversalEntity.md) - The enhanced entity implementation with visual representation

### Entity Management
- [JSHEntityManager](JSHEntityManager.md) - Central system for entity creation, tracking, and lifecycle management
- Handles entity registration, processing, and retrieval

### Entity Evolution
- [JSHEntityEvolution](JSHEntityEvolution.md) - System for managing entity evolution through stages
- Controls complexity-based progression and transformation

### Entity Commands
- [JSHEntityCommands](JSHEntityCommands.md) - Command interface for entity manipulation
- Provides a command-based API for entity operations

### Entity Visualization
- [JSHEntityVisualizer](JSHEntityVisualizer.md) - Visual representation of entities
- Manages 3D models and effects for different entity types and forms

## Entity Lifecycle

Entities in the JSH Ethereal Engine follow a specific lifecycle:

1. **Creation**:
   - Entities are created from words through the Word Manifestation system
   - Properties are derived from word analysis
   - Initial form is determined by element affinity

2. **Evolution**:
   - Entities increase in complexity over time
   - Progress through evolution stages (0-5)
   - Gain new abilities and visual enhancements

3. **Transformation**:
   - Entities can transform between different types
   - Forms change based on transformations
   - Visual representation updates accordingly

4. **Interaction**:
   - Entities can connect to other entities
   - Interaction results depend on entity types
   - Connections are visually represented

5. **Splitting/Merging**:
   - Complex entities can split into simpler entities
   - Multiple entities can be merged into more complex forms
   - Parent-child relationships are tracked

6. **Destruction**:
   - Entities can be explicitly destroyed
   - Resources are properly cleaned up

## Entity Types and Forms

The system supports various entity types and forms:

### Element-Based Types
- **Fire**: Heat and energy-based entities
- **Water**: Fluid and flow-based entities
- **Earth**: Solid and stability-based entities
- **Air**: Movement and space-based entities
- **Metal**: Structure and rigidity-based entities
- **Wood**: Growth and life-based entities

### Special Types
- **Primordial**: Base entities with minimal differentiation
- **Void**: Entities representing emptiness or absence
- **Light**: Entities of pure illumination
- **Dark**: Entities of shadow and obscurity
- **Abstract**: Conceptual entities
- **Merged**: Entities created from multiple sources

### Visual Forms
- **Seed**: Initial form of most entities
- **Flame**: Fire-based visual form
- **Droplet**: Water-based visual form
- **Crystal**: Earth-based visual form
- **Wisp**: Air-based visual form
- And many more specialized forms

## Entity Properties

Entities have various properties that define their behavior and characteristics:

- **Physical Properties**: Mass, volume, temperature, etc.
- **Elemental Properties**: Element-specific characteristics
- **Energy Properties**: Power levels, resonance, etc.
- **Complexity**: Measure of entity sophistication
- **Tags**: Categorization labels
- **Metadata**: Additional information storage

## Zone System

Entities are organized in spatial zones for efficient management:

- Zones group entities by location
- Entities can belong to multiple zones
- Zone-based queries for spatial operations
- Limits on entities per zone for performance

## Integration Points

The Entity System integrates with several other systems:

- **Word System**: Entities are created from words
- **Spatial System**: Entities exist in spatial zones
- **Console System**: Commands can manipulate entities
- **Visualization System**: Entities have visual representation

## Usage Examples

```gdscript
# Creating an entity
var entity_manager = JSHEntityManager.get_instance()
var entity = entity_manager.create_entity("fire", {"energy": 100})

# Evolving an entity
entity.evolve(0.5)

# Transforming an entity
entity.transform("plasma")

# Connecting entities
entity1.connect_to(entity2, "harmony")

# Finding entities by criteria
var water_entities = entity_manager.find_entities({"type": "water"})
```
