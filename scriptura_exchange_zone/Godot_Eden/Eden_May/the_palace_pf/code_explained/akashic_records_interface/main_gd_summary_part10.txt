## Notable Patterns
1. Tree Structure Management: Hierarchical node tracking
2. Path-Based Access: Slash-delimited paths for node access
3. Type-Based Processing: Different behavior based on node type
4. Thread Safety: Consistent mutex usage with try_lock optimization
5. Functional Programming: Uses closures for recursive operations
6. Task Delegation: Offloads completion tasks to the task system
7. Error Handling: Extensive error checking and fallbacks
8. Counter Tracking: Precise node counting for completeness tracking

## Implementation Details
- ASCII Art Headers: Decorative section markers
- Vector3i State: Three-dimensional state tracking (x, y, z)
- Queue Processing: Limited items per cycle (max_*_per_cycle)
- Parent-Child Relationships: Path-based hierarchy building
- Metadata-Rich Nodes: Extensive node metadata tracking
- Node Type Translation: JSH to Godot type translation
- Status Management: "active", "pending", "disabled" states
