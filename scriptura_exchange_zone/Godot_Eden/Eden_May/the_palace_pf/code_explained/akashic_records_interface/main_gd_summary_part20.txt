  - Elemental word definition:
    - Fire: Positioned at (10, 0, 0)
    - Water: Positioned at (-10, 0, 0)

## Technical Note
The file ends mid-function at line 9523, with the loop body for word_data element creation not shown in the available text. This suggests there might be additional functionality in the full implementation to manifest each word as an element in the 3D space.

This final section completes the element manifestation system, bringing full circle the engine's philosophical underpinning - where words and concepts can be manifested as physical elements within a digitally constructed reality. The elemental system represents the culmination of the engine's capabilities, combining procedural generation, spatial positioning, and concept materialization.
