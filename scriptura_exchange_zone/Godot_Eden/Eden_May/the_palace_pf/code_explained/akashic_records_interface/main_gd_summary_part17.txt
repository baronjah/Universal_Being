This section reveals the JSH Ethereal Engine's unusual approach to reality simulation, with multiple overlapping realities, procedural generation from words, and a metaphysical framework of "godlike" creators and guardians. The system combines technical features (chunk management, marching cubes) with philosophical elements (reality shifting, memory, déjà vu).
