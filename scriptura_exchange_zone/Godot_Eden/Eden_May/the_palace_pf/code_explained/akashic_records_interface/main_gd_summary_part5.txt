# Main.gd Summary - Lines 2000-2500

## Task Management Continued (Lines 2000-2004)
- Continuation of queue_pusher_adder() function
- Task duration checking and timeout handling

## Creation Set Management (Lines 2005-2062)
- check_currently_being_created_sets(): Extensive checking of creation states
  - Complex nested conditions for set state tracking
  - Thread-safe operations with multiple mutexes
  - Load queue status management

## Multi-Stage Creation Pipeline (Lines 2063-2223)
- process_stages(): Main orchestrator for creation stages
  - Manages a 7-stage creation pipeline (0-6)
  - Uses curent_queue for state tracking
  - Thread-safe processing with mutexes
- Stage-specific functions:
  - first_stage_of_creation_(): Initializes menu
  - second_stage_of_creation_() / second_impact_for_real(): Container setup
  - third_stage_of_creation_() / third_impact_right_now(): Data loading
  - fourth_impact_of_creation_() / fourth_impact_right_now(): Secondary data loading
  - fifth_impact_of_creation_() / fifth_impact_right_now(): Progress tracking
  - sixth_impact_of_creation() / sixth_impact_right_now(): Finalization
  - Each stage runs in a separate thread via create_new_task()

## File Management System (Lines 2225-2478)
- File creation functions:
  - file_creation(): Creates file with given content
  - create_file(): Creates file from array data
  - save_file_list_text(): Saves directory scan results as text
  - create_default_settings(): Creates default settings file
  - save_file_list_json(): Saves scan results as JSON
- Directory and file checking:
  - find_or_create_eden_directory(): Locates or creates Eden directory
  - file_finder(): Finds file in a list
  - check_folder() / check_folder_content(): Directory verification
- Settings management:
  - check_settings_file(): Comprehensive settings file management
  - Handles both settings.txt and modules.txt
  - Creates default settings if not present
  - Updates paths based on settings
- Path management:
  - update_main_path(): Updates main path variable
  - update_database_path(): Updates database folder variable

## Data Type Demonstration (Lines 2346-2388)
- Extensive showcase of GDScript data types with comments:
  - Strings (empty and non-empty)
  - Arrays and Dictionaries
  - Numeric types (int and float)
  - Vector types (Vector2/3/4 and their integer variants)
  - Basis and Quaternion types
  - Each with explanatory comments

## Notable Patterns
1. Multi-Stage Processing: Seven-stage creation pipeline
2. Thread Safety: Extensive use of mutexes to protect shared data
3. File System Integration: Comprehensive directory and file management
4. Settings Management: Default creation and loading
5. Task Delegation: Each major operation runs in a separate thread
6. Progress Tracking: Detailed state management for creation stages
7. ASCII Art Headers: Decorative section headers throughout
