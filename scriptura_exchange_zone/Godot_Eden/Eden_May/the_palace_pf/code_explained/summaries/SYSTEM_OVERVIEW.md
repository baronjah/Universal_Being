# Project System Overview

This document provides an overview of the various systems in the project and how they interact with each other.

## Core Systems

### Akashic Records System
- **Main Script**: `JSH_AkashicRecordsSystem` (in JSH_Akashic_Records.gd)
- **Purpose**: Serves as the central knowledge system and dictionary for all entities and interactions
- **Key Components**:
  - `AkashicRecordsManagerA`: Manages the dictionary of words and entities
  - `DynamicDictionary`: Handles storage and retrieval of definitions
  - `ZoneManagerA`: Manages spatial organization of entities
  - `ThingCreatorA`: Creates and manages physical instances of entities
  - `UniversalBridge`: Connects different systems together

### Menu and Console System
- Found in `Menu_Keyboard_Console` folder
- Provides user interface and command-line interaction
- Contains a multi-threading system that could be reused elsewhere

### Galaxy and Planet Generation
- Split between `Galaxy_Star_Planet` and `Planet_Cloud_Water_Grass` folders
- Handles procedural generation of celestial bodies
- These systems should be connected for a cohesive space environment

### Domino Grid Chunks System
- Found in `Domino_Grid_Chunks` folder
- Manages map zones, flora/fauna life cycles, and environmental effects
- Could be integrated with the Zone Manager in Akashic Records

### Snake Space Movement
- Found in `Snake_Space_Movement` folder
- Provides movement mechanics for space navigation

### Ethereal Engine
- Database and dictionary systems for storing and retrieving large datasets
- Could have overlap with Akashic Records system

## Fixed Issues

1. **Class Structure**:
   - Fixed `debug_ui.gd` to extend Control instead of Node
   - Corrected instance creation in ThingCreator and AkashicDebugUI

2. **Dictionary Property Access**:
   - Fixed access to dictionary properties in `dynamic_dictionary.gd`
   - Changed direct property access to use `has()` and array access

3. **Function Return Types**:
   - Fixed return type mismatch in `akashic_records_manager.gd`
   - Ensured boolean values are always returned when required

4. **Method Call Corrections**:
   - Fixed console command registration to use Callable objects
   - Corrected various mismatched method signatures

## Integration Plan

1. The Akashic Records system should serve as the central data hub
2. Universal Bridge connects this to visual and physical systems
3. Domino Grid Chunks provides environmental rules and procedural generation
4. Galaxy/Planet systems create the visual space environment
5. Menu/Console system provides the user interface

## Next Steps

1. Continue mapping system dependencies in detail
2. Check for duplicate functionality between Console systems
3. Connect planet generation systems
4. Integrate the multi-threading system from Menu Console
5. Connect Snake Space Movement to main gameplay
6. Audit database systems for potential integration
