   - Each form uses appropriate 3D primitives (spheres, cones, cylinders, etc.)
   - Forms have unique colors and material properties

2. **Particle Effects**:
   - Form-specific particle systems
   - Evolution-enhanced particle effects
   - Transformation visual effects
   - Connection visualization between entities

3. **Evolution Visualization**:
   - Visual scaling based on evolution stage
   - Increased emission effects at higher stages
   - Material property changes (metallicity, roughness)
   - Additional particle effects at advanced stages

### Entity Evolution Process

The entity evolution system has been enhanced:

1. **Complexity Calculation**:
   - Base complexity from entity type
   - Property-based complexity contribution
   - Reference-based complexity (connections)
   - Time-based complexity growth
   - Transformation history factor
   - Child entity factor

2. **Evolution Stages (0-5)**:
   - Stage 0: Seed stage (complexity < 10)
   - Stage 1: Developing stage (complexity 10-50)
   - Stage 2: Advanced stage (complexity 50-100)
   - Stage 3: Complex stage (complexity 100-200)

   - Special properties from concepts
   - Element blending for mixed words
   - Reality context influence
   - Metadata from word structure

### Word Combination System

A new system for combining words has been implemented:

1. **Combination Process**:
   - Multiple words can be combined into a single entity
   - Properties from each word contribute to the result
   - Numeric properties are averaged
   - String properties are combined
   - Dictionaries are merged
   - Complexity receives a combination bonus

2. **Database Tracking**:
   - Successful combinations are recorded
   - Properties of combined entities are saved
   - Combinations can be reused

3. **Emergent Properties**:
   - Combinations can produce new properties not in original words
   - Certain combinations have special results
   - Opposite elements create reaction effects

## Integration Architecture

The system uses a modular architecture with well-defined integration points:

1. **Core System Integration**:
   - GameController initializes and connects all components
   - Universal Entity is created by Word Manifestor
   - Creation Console processes commands through Word Manifestor
   - Word Manifestor places entities in the world

2. **Fallback Systems**:
   - Each component has fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies
   - GameController creates minimal implementations when needed
   - Core components check for specialized versions before using default

3. **Extension Points**:
   - Analyzer system can be extended with specialized analyzers
   - Entity system supports custom entity types and forms
   - Word Manifestor can be extended with new commands
   - Game Controller can integrate with additional systems

The resulting JSH Ethereal Engine provides a robust foundation for creating, evolving, and interacting with entities manifested from words. The system is well-documented, organized, and extensible, providing a solid platform for future development.

The implementation achieves the core goal of creating a system where "words shape reality," allowing users to manifest entities through language, observe their evolution, and create complex interactions between them. The visual representation system brings these entities to life in 3D space, making the abstract concept of word manifestation tangible and interactive.

This implementation completes the requirements outlined in the integration plan and establishes a framework that can be extended with additional features and capabilities in future development phases.
