# Project Regenesis Integration Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for integrating the various components of Project Regenesis into a cohesive, working system. The goal is to create a unified architecture where every object is a point that can become anything, evolve, and interact with other points.

## Core Architecture

We've identified the following core systems:

1. **Akashic Records System**: Dictionary, entity definitions, and interactions
2. **Element System**: Visual representation of elements in 3D space
3. **Console System**: User interface for interaction and commands
4. **Thing Creator**: Bridge between dictionary entries and visual elements
5. **Universal Bridge**: Central connection point for all systems

## Phase 1: System Initialization

### Step 1: Core System Setup
1. Create a main scene with an autoload singleton for UniversalBridge
2. Add the AkashicRecordsManager as an autoload
3. Add the ThingCreator as an autoload
4. Create a main scene with the console UI, ElementManager, and visual components

### Step 2: Directory Structure
1. Ensure all scripts are organized in appropriate folders
2. Create necessary data directories for dictionary files
3. Set up resource directories for models, materials, and shaders

### Step 3: Scene Setup
1. Create a main scene that contains:
   - A 3D viewport for the world
   - The console UI (2D overlay or 3D object)
   - An ElementManager node
   - A Camera3D with appropriate controls

## Phase 2: Core System Implementation

### Step 1: Initialize Universal Bridge
1. In the main scene's _ready() function, get the UniversalBridge instance
2. Call initialize() on the bridge to set up all system connections
3. Ensure all systems are properly linked through the bridge

### Step 2: Basic Dictionary Setup
1. Create core dictionary entries through the bridge:
   - Add primordial entity
   - Add basic elements (fire, water, wood, ash)
   - Add basic interactions

### Step 3: Console Integration
1. Set up the console UI
2. Register commands for creating and manipulating entities
3. Connect the console to the UniversalBridge

## Phase 3: Feature Implementation

### Step 1: Word Creation and Evolution
1. Implement the create_word function in the UI
2. Set up the EvolutionManager to monitor word usage
3. Create a test UI for observing word evolution

### Step 2: Visual Entity Creation
1. Implement the create_thing_from_word function in the UI
2. Set up the ElementManager to create visual elements
3. Create a test UI for creating entities

### Step 3: Interaction System
1. Implement the process_thing_interaction function in the UI
2. Test basic interactions between elements
3. Visualize the results of interactions

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### Step 1: Dynamic Dictionary Splitting
1. Implement the DictionarySplitter class
2. Create a monitoring system for dictionary size
3. Test automatic splitting when entries grow too complex

### Step 2: Zone Management
1. Implement the ZoneManager with dynamic chunking
2. Test zone splitting and merging based on entity density
3. Implement performance-based zone management

### Step 3: Serialization and Persistence
1. Implement saving and loading of dictionary entries
2. Create a system for saving the state of the world
3. Test persistence across sessions

## Phase 5: Performance Optimization

### Step 1: Resource Management
1. Implement the ResourceManager class
2. Add LOD (Level of Detail) system for elements
3. Optimize rendering based on distance from camera

### Step 2: Parallel Processing
1. Set up the ThreadPoolManager for parallel tasks
2. Optimize entity processing with batched updates
3. Implement asynchronous loading of dictionary entries

### Step 3: Memory Management
1. Create a system for unloading distant or inactive zones
2. Implement reference counting for shared resources
3. Optimize dictionary access patterns

## Phase 6: Final Integration and Testing

### Step 1: End-to-End Testing
1. Create a test suite for all core functions
2. Create scenarios that exercise all systems
3. Monitor performance and optimize bottlenecks

### Step 2: User Experience
1. Create a tutorial scenario
2. Refine the UI for better usability
3. Add help text and documentation

### Step 3: Final Polish
1. Add visual effects for interactions
2. Implement sound effects
3. Create a starting experience that introduces the concepts

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation with the UniversalBridge class
2. Set up a basic test scene with minimal functionality
3. Implement one feature at a time, testing thoroughly before moving on
4. Regular integration tests to ensure all systems work together
