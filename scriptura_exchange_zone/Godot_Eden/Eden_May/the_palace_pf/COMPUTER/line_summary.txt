# Line.gd Summary

## File Overview
- Path: res://code/gdscript/scripts/Menu_Keyboard_Console/line.gd
- Primary class: Extends MeshInstance3D
- A 3D line rendering component that creates visual connections between points

## Functions (Lines 5-31)
- _ready(): Initialization function that calls send_any_message()
- change_points_of_line(start_end_points): Updates the line endpoints
  - Takes an array containing two points (start and end)
  - Converts input arrays to Vector3 objects
  - Retrieves the ImmediateMesh from the mesh property
  - Clears existing surfaces
  - Creates a new surface using PRIMITIVE_LINES
  - Adds two vertices to form a line between point1 and point2
  - Finalizes the surface
- send_any_message(): Simple debug function that prints the node name

## Technical Implementation
- Uses Godot's ImmediateMesh system for dynamic line creation
- Expects input as nested arrays: [[x1,y1,z1],[x2,y2,z2]]
- Completely regenerates the line mesh when endpoints change
- Designed for simple point-to-point connections in 3D space

## Notable Features
- Simple and focused implementation
- Dynamic line rendering
- Efficiently clears and rebuilds only when needed
- Visual connection component for the larger system
