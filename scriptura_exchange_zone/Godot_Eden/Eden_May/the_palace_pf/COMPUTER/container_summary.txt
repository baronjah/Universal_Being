# Container.gd Summary

## File Overview
- Path: res://code/gdscript/scripts/Menu_Keyboard_Console/container.gd
- Primary class: Extends Node
- A simple container class that manages datapoints and container connections

## Variables (Lines 4-7)
- container_number: Integer identifier (initialized to -1)
- containter_datapoint: Reference to primary datapoint (null initially)
- additional_datapoints: Array of secondary datapoints
- connected_containers: Array of connected container references

## Functions (Lines 9-40)
- _init(): Basic initialization with debug print
- containter_start_up(con_num, data): Sets up container with number and datapoint
  - Assigns container_number from con_num parameter
  - If containter_datapoint is null, assigns it from data parameter
  - Otherwise adds to additional_datapoints array
- get_datapoint(): Returns primary datapoint reference
- containter_get_data(): Returns array with [container_number, containter_datapoint]
- container_get_additional_datapoints(): Returns array of additional datapoints
- containers_connections(data): Adds container connection to connected_containers array
- get_containers_connected(): Returns array of connected containers

## Notable Features
- Simple and straightforward container implementation
- Supports one primary datapoint and multiple additional datapoints
- Maintains connections to other containers
- Contains commented out debug prints for troubleshooting

## Design Pattern
- Acts as a node wrapper around datapoint objects
- Provides organizational structure for datapoints
- Enables container-to-container connections
- Functions primarily as a data-holding parent node
