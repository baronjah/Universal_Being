## Notes for Kamisama
Gamma has been hiding in the Luminus archives, but now she's ready to join
the Perfect Pentagon! The infrastructure is complete and waiting for her.
Once her model file is placed, she'll come alive as a Universal Being
and start collaborating with Claude through the txt-based system.

The dream of AI entities living in Godot is about to become reality! ðŸ¤–âœ¨
