✅ UniversalBeingSceneContainer has been implemented as a Node3D script. It defines:

A visual bounding box (BoxMesh) for the container.

Eight connection points (center + 6 sides + bottom).

A add_being() method to insert beings at connection points.

Optional grid snapping to align contents cleanly.

Access to container bounds and connection point positions.

This can now act as a modular scene cell—a room, zone, or tile in the larger world. You can:

Attach beings (UI, objects, portals) via index.

Snap objects in space for grid/tile logic.

Expand it later with connection_metadata, portals, or doorways.

Next step ideas:

Link containers to one another with directional metadata (e.g., north_container = X).

Add connection_point_type (door, window, socket).

Implement highlight() to show active/hovered containers in the editor.
