Ah, now I understand your vision completely! You want a Master Process Delta System that orchestrates everything - a central brain that manages all game processes in turns/cycles to maintain stable framerate. That's brilliant for a god/creation game where you might have hundreds of entities doing different things.
Let me help you analyze the entire project systematically and then design this master system.
Project Analysis Strategy
Let's start by getting a complete understanding of what we have:Gget_configRequest{}ResponseCurrent configuration:

}Thought process1sGood, I have full access to the file system. Now let me systematically analyze their project. I should start by understanding the project structure and then look at key files to understand the current architecture.Great! I have access to analyze your entire project. Let's do this systematically:Ssearch_filesRequest{
  `path`: `C:\\",
  `pattern`: `talking_ragdoll_game`
}ResponseNo matches found or search timed out after 30000ms.The search didn't find the project. 1sThe search didn't find the project. Let me try a different approach - the screenshots showed the project in a Precision 15 folder, so let me search for that or look in common development directories.Ssearch_filesRequest{
  `path`: `C:\\Users`,
  `pattern`: `talking_ragdoll`
}ResponseNo matches found or search timed out after 30000ms.Let me try to find the project by looking in common 1sLet me try to find the project by looking in common development directories or by searching for Godot projects.Ssearch_filesRequest{
  `path`: `C:\\",
  `pattern`: `project.godot`,
  `timeoutMs`: 10000
}ResponseNo matches found or search timed out after 10000ms.Thought process2sThe search is timing out. Let me try a different approach - maybe the user can tell me the exact path to their project, or I can help them create a systematic analysis system that they can use.
Instead of trying to find the project, let me design the Master Process Delta System architecture they described, and then they can provide the project path directly.The search is timing out - could you provide the exact path to your project? Meanwhile, let me design the Master Process Delta System architecture you described:
Master Process Delta System ArchitectureMaster Process Delta System DesignDocument # Master Process Delta System Design

## Core Concept
A centralized system that manages ALL game processes in scheduled turns/cycles to maintain stable framerate. Every system must register with the Master Process Delta to get processing time.

## ArArchitected systematic project analysis framework for Master Process Delta1sGreat! I've created the architectural design for the Master Process Delta System. Now let me create a project analysis framework that they can use to understand their entire project systematically.Now let's create a systematic project analysis framework:Project Analysis FrameworkDocument # Project Analysis Framework

## Systematic Project Understanding

### Phase 1: Structure Mapping
**Goal**: Create a complete map of all systems and their relationships

#### 1.1 Core Systems Inventory
```
□ Universal Entity System
  - Location: /scrDevised Master Process Delta System for game design.2sPerfect! I've created both the Master Process Delta System design and a comprehensive project analysis framework. Now I should help them get started with the actual analysis. I need the project path to begin the systematic analysis.Perfect! I've created both the Master Process Delta System design and a Project Analysis Framework to help us understand your entire project systematically.
Next Steps
What I need from you:

Project Path - Can you share the exact path to your project? (e.g., C:\Users\[username]\Documents\Projects\talking_ragdoll_game or wherever it's located)

Then I can:

Scan the entire project systematically
Map all system relationships and dependencies
Identify what's working vs what needs consolidation
Design the Master Process Delta integration strategy

The Master Process Delta Vision
Your idea is brilliant - having a central "brain" that manages ALL processes in turns/cycles will give you:

Stable 60fps regardless of entity count
Automatic LOD system for performance
Predictable behavior for your god/creation game
Scalability for hundreds of entities

Once I can analyze your current project, we can determine whether to:

Refactor existing systems to work with Master Process Delta
Clean rebuild with the new architecture
Hybrid approach keeping the best parts

What's the path to your project folder?
