# message starting 
well, maybe we can start again, and clean a lot of the documentation’s we have done so far, maybe i will make new wish list, idea, and based on what we done so far, can create that game? but i need your help with that, what game needs, console, that creates, changes, archives, unload load, so we need an floodgate for loading, unloading, changing nodes with console i can write into and inspect in game, what else we need, database system for entire game world, universal entity, which will become anything, as it will just have several properties like type, group, name, version? and based on that while two universal entities are the same, one is named fish, another cat, so cat eat fish after catching it, and the fish becomes part of cat in some way, but it was just text game, wasn’t it? words with rules change what we see in text, but now seen in 3d game engine, and the user can click, select with console, anthony and change it with object inspector, an object inspect is like an cell in csv file, for one thing, where where that csv might be an dictionary for all things that are in the scene rn, and that cell in itself is like another csv file where again cosmos can happen, just the same way godot stack nodes on each other, if an node is child, and parent of it moves, so does child, similar with that interactive database i am talking now, the possible actions, possible states, possible groups, possible types, possible visualisation, possible animations, as cat need to move around too, to catch it, now we will focus on universal_being, which needs an area node and collision shape, lets us sphere for that, so we wont worry about corners of cubes :) everything in project needs to be prepared for changes, additions continuation so we must create first some development blueprints of ideas, rules, to maintain the project continuity of completion, there is also an need for universal entity to become anything, even water and ground too, so everything is the same, in a sense, its monitored and maintained in the same way, for adding visual aspect to any universal entity, we can take a route where each of these, needs its own separate scene, with the same limit of size, so we can maintain the same scale system in entire project, and let’s not worry too much about physics, let’s make this game in a way where character physics body for now is just that sphere, that maintain balance, knows where is up, down, so the future animation of characters and trees and anything will work good,

i am not sure yet, let me take screenshots of the project we work on right now, so you can see what you created so far in what way, remeber that i am talking to you, so here we either will have it better than you normally work and seen or who knows

# continuing
this is main directory, docs should have what we see in few files here and there, mostly md files that are informational, the copy ragdoll all files folder was me, searching all files with ragdoll in them, and sticking them to one folder, for some reason, example scenes have the txt versions of scenes, that we load in game, have also look at scripts folder, it has many folders in it, nice , also take a look at autoloads, a lot of them, the main_game scene has just one script attached to it
###
# continuing
but we also need an way to look through entire project, all files, in a smart way, that we understand, maybe few times we might need to do that, to understand entire project flow, possibilities, and while we can have several version of the same idea, ragdoll, ragdoll_v2, walker, biowalker, we should probably understand the commands reason, need, etc, but thats  not about it, my most important goal is that floodgates, universal_being/.entity needs to go through these floodgates, while we also need some kind of master_process_delta script, that maintain every single process in game and keeps it in turns, this way we can implement some kind of lod system for game, to maintan stable framerate all the time, in that creation game, god game of mine :)

# continuing
the project is here, please just take a look, i will collect artifacts from this chat, and put it in here, somewhere later, and tell you over terminal C:\Users\Percision 15\talking_ragdoll_game
