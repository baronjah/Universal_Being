Wow! This is quite an extensive project! I can see exactly what happened - we've built a comprehensive system but it's grown quite complex. Let me break down what I'm seeing:
Current Architecture Analysis
Strong Foundation Already Built:

UniversalEntity system is already there (in core folder)
ConsoleManager exists for runtime commands
FloodgateController for loading/unloading
WorldBuilder for scene management
Extensive documentation system (all those .md files)

The Complexity Issue:

25+ autoloads (that's a lot of global systems!)
Multiple versions (ragdoll, ragdoll_v2)
"patches" and "old_implementations" folders showing iteration
JSH framework layer on top

What's Working Well:

Organized folder structure (autoload, components, core, etc.)
Documentation system is extensive
Universal entity concept is implemented
Console system exists

Decision Point
Given what I see, I think we have two solid options:
Option A: Strategic Cleanup

Keep the core systems (UniversalEntity, ConsoleManager, WorldBuilder)
Consolidate the ragdoll systems
Reduce autoloads to essential ones only
Clean up redundant scripts

Option B: Fresh Start with Lessons

Take the working concepts and documentation
Build a cleaner, more focused architecture
Apply everything we learned
