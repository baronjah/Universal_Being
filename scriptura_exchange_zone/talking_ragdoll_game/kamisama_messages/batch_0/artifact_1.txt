# Project Analysis Framework

## Systematic Project Understanding

### Phase 1: Structure Mapping
**Goal**: Create a complete map of all systems and their relationships

#### 1.1 Core Systems Inventory
```
□ Universal Entity System
  - Location: /scripts/core/universal_entity/
  - Dependencies: ?
  - Integration points: ?

□ Console System  
  - Location: /scripts/autoload/console_manager.gd
  - Commands available: ?
  - Integration: ?

□ Floodgate System
  - Location: /scripts/core/floodgate_controller.gd
  - Current functionality: ?
  - Missing features: ?

□ World Builder
  - Location: /scripts/autoload/world_builder.gd
  - Capabilities: ?
  - Scene management: ?
```

#### 1.2 Autoload Analysis
**Current Count**: 25+ autoloads (potentially too many)

**Critical Questions**:
- Which autoloads are essential?
- Which ones overlap in functionality?
- What's the loading order dependency?
- Which can be consolidated?

#### 1.3 Version Tracking
```
Systems with Multiple Versions:
□ ragdoll vs ragdoll_v2
  - What's different?
  - Which is current?
  - Can they be merged?

□ walker vs biowalker
  - Purpose of each?
  - Integration status?

□ patches folder
  - What was being fixed?
  - Are fixes integrated?
```

### Phase 2: Functional Analysis
**Goal**: Understand what actually works vs what needs fixing

#### 2.1 Working Systems Assessment
```
Test each major system:
□ Can spawn universal entities?
□ Console commands functional?
□ Floodgate loading/unloading works?
□ Scene transitions work?
□ Physics integration stable?
```

#### 2.2 Integration Points Mapping
```
System Relationships:
UniversalEntity -> Floodgate -> WorldBuilder -> Scene
                -> Console -> Inspector -> Database
                -> Physics -> Renderer -> Audio
```

#### 2.3 Performance Bottlenecks
```
□ Too many autoloads causing startup lag?
□ Redundant systems running simultaneously?
□ Memory leaks from unloaded entities?
□ Console system performance impact?
```

### Phase 3: Architecture Harmony Assessment
**Goal**: Determine if current architecture supports your Master Process Delta vision

#### 3.1 Master Process Delta Readiness
```
Current State Analysis:
□ Are systems designed for turn-based processing?
□ Can systems be paused/resumed safely?
□ Do systems have priority levels?
□ Are there circular dependencies blocking centralized control?
```

#### 3.2 Floodgate System Current State
```
□ What floodgates currently exist?
□ Do all entities go through floodgates?
□ Is there a queue management system?
□ Performance monitoring capability?
```

#### 3.3 Universal Entity System Status
```
□ Do all game objects inherit from UniversalEntity?
□ Required properties implemented? (type, group, name, version)
□ Database integration working?
□ Inspector system functional?
```

## Analysis Tools Needed

### 1. Project Scanner Script
Create a script that automatically:
- Counts all .gd files by folder
- Lists all autoloads and their dependencies  
- Maps @export variables across systems
- Identifies potential circular references

### 2. System Dependency Mapper
Visual tool showing:
- Which systems talk to which other systems
- Data flow between systems
- Potential consolidation opportunities

### 3. Performance Profiler Integration
- Track which systems consume most processing time
- Identify candidates for Master Process Delta management
- Find systems that could benefit from LOD

## Decision Matrix

### Keep vs Rebuild Assessment
For each major system, evaluate:

| System | Complexity | Functionality | Integration | Decision |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| UniversalEntity | ? | ? | ? | Keep/Rebuild/Merge |
| Console | ? | ? | ? | Keep/Rebuild/Merge |
| Floodgate | ? | ? | ? | Keep/Rebuild/Merge |
| JSH Framework | ? | ? | ? | Keep/Rebuild/Merge |

### Consolidation Opportunities
```
Potential Merges:
□ Multiple ragdoll systems -> Single ragdoll system
□ Similar autoloads -> Combined manager
□ Duplicate console functionality -> Unified console
□ Redundant entity management -> Pure UniversalEntity
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Strategic Refactoring
1. Keep working core systems
2. Consolidate redundant systems  
3. Implement Master Process Delta over existing architecture
4. Gradual migration to new patterns

### Option B: Clean Rebuild
1. Extract working concepts and data structures
2. Rebuild with Master Process Delta from ground up
3. Implement only essential systems initially
4. Add complexity gradually with proper architecture

### Option C: Hybrid Approach  
1. Keep UniversalEntity and Console systems
2. Rebuild Floodgate system for Master Process Delta compatibility
3. Consolidate autoloads to essential ones
4. Migrate other systems one by one

## Next Steps Checklist
□ Provide exact project path for analysis
□ Run automated project scanner
□ Test current functionality of major systems
□ Create system dependency map
□ Make keep/rebuild/merge decisions
□ Design Master Process Delta implementation plan
