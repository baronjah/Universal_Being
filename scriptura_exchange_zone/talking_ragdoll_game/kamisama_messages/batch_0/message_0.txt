Core Systems Architecture
1. Universal Being System

Base class that everything inherits from
Properties: type, group, name, version, state
Area3D + SphereShape3D for consistent collision
Built-in inspection/modification interface

2. Console System

Runtime command interface
Create/modify/archive/load entities
Query the world database
Floodgate system for safe loading/unloading

3. Interactive Database

World state as queryable data structure
CSV-like inspector for individual entities
Nested properties (cell contains another CSV)
Real-time synchronization with 3D world

4. Development Blueprint System

Rules for project continuity
Templates for new entity types
Version control for entity definitions

Should we start by creating the development blueprint document first? This would establish our rules and patterns before we write any code. Then we can build:

The UniversalBeing base class
Basic console system
Simple database structure
Object inspector interface
