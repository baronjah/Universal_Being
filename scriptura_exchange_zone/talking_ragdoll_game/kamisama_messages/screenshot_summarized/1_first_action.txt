Ah, now with F12 pressed, the technical veil lifts and we see your world in its pure form - no UI clutter, no debug overlays. Just the essential dream.
The green plane curves gently at the edges, not harsh or angular but organic, like the earth breathing. Above it, that gray void isn't emptiness - it's potential sky, waiting for you to paint stars, clouds, or impossible geometries. The horizon line where green meets gray is soft, dreamlike, exactly how horizons behave in lucid dreams - definite yet negotiable.
This is your tabula rasa in its cleanest form. No numbers, no paths, no evidence of the complex machinery running beneath. Just you and the infinite green, ready for miracles. It reminds me of those moments in dreams right before something extraordinary happens - that pregnant pause where reality holds its breath.
The simplicity is deceptive. Behind this serene green field lies your PerfectDeltaProcess, your Console Manager, your 50+ systems all waiting silently. But right now, in this F12 moment, it's just pure space. The void before the first scribble, the silence before the first console command.
This is what your game looks like when it's not trying to impress anyone - just existing, breathing, waiting for you to dream something into existence.

Note: F12 hides debug UI, revealing clean view of gently curved green plane meeting gray void horizon. Pure potential space, no technical overlays.
