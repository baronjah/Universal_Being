# üåü THE DREAMER'S UNIVERSAL RULES
## Three Sacred Places Connected - All Projects United
*Auto-loaded when Claude Code starts anywhere*

---

## üìç OUR THREE SACRED PLACES

### 1. üéÆ **Main Game Realm**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/talking_ragdoll_game/`
- **The Active Dream** - Where miracles happen
- Current project with 50+ systems working in harmony
- PerfectDeltaProcess controls ALL frame processing
- From scribbles to UFOs daily

### 2. üèõÔ∏è **Knowledge Temple**: `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/Desktop/claude_desktop/`
- **The Memory Palace** - 200+ documentation files
- Navigation hubs, strongholds of knowledge
- Historical context and breakthrough records
- Evolution from 2 years of conversations

### 3. üåå **WSL Ubuntu Home**: `/home/kamisama/`
- **The Linux Sanctuary** - Pure development space
- System configs and experimental grounds
- Safe from Windows kernel complications
- Linux purity for serious work

### 4. üöÄ **D: Drive Universe**: `/mnt/d/`
- **The Massive Archive** - ADDONS, BECOME, Creations
- Extended projects and large datasets
- Future expansion space

## ‚ö° UNIVERSAL CODING RULES

### üéØ **THE ONE RULE**: Perfect Delta Process
### the same for any other build in godot function, the pentagon vision
```gdscript
# NEVER use _process() or _physics_process() directly!
# Register with PerfectDelta instead:

func _ready():
    PerfectDelta.register_process(self, process_managed, 80, "physics")

func process_managed(delta: float):
    # Your code with accumulated delta - physics stay perfect!
    position += velocity * delta
```

### üé≠ **Architecture Harmony Rules**
1. **ONE ragdoll** - biowalker is the chosen one
2. **ONE floodgate** - all objects go through it  
3. **ONE console** - commands for everything
4. **ONE inspector** - modify anything clickable

### üåü **Evolution Philosophy**
- **Scribble** ‚Üí **Forming** ‚Üí **Perfect UFO**
- Every feature follows this transformation
- User creates with "shaky hands" - system makes it perfect
- From chaos to miracles through code

---

## üìù MANDATORY SCRIPT HEADERS

```gdscript
# ==================================================
# SCRIPT NAME: [filename].gd
# DESCRIPTION: [What it does in the dream]
# PURPOSE: [Why it exists - connect to 2-year vision]
# CREATED: [Date] - [Context/milestone]
# ==================================================
```

## üéÆ CONSOLE COMMANDS TO REMEMBER

### Architecture
- `arch_status` - See harmony overview
- `arch_ragdolls` - List all 4 ragdoll types
- `arch_conflicts` - Find duplicates

### Performance  
- `fps_status` - Check frame distribution
- `delta_stats` - Perfect delta statistics
- `declutter_status` - Distance-based optimization

### Creation
- `orchestra` - Toggle Script Orchestra (F9)
- `miracle` - Transform scribble to UFO
- `universal_spawn` - Create universal being

---

## üîß PROJECT MERGER RULES

### Duplicate Detection Protocol
1. **Check existing first** - Run `arch_status`
2. **Find the best version** - Usually newest with most features
3. **Merge carefully** - Copy best parts to chosen implementation
4. **Delete duplicates** - Keep only the perfected version
5. **Update references** - All calls point to unified system

### Evolution Example: Ragdoll Progression
```
Simple Rectangle (scribble)
    ‚Üì
Added joints (forming)  
    ‚Üì
Seven-part ragdoll (more forming)
    ‚Üì
Biomechanical walker (perfect UFO!)
```

### File Consolidation Rules
- Multiple scripts doing same thing = choose best, evolve it
- Each system has ONE authoritative implementation
- Archive old versions in `scripts/old_implementations/`
- Document evolution in headers

---

## üéØ QUALITY GATES FOR ALL PROJECTS

### Before ANY commit:
- [ ] Follows PerfectDeltaProcess pattern
- [ ] Has console command integration
- [ ] Works with object inspector
- [ ] Maintains 60 FPS target
- [ ] Connected to floodgate if relevant
- [ ] Proper script header
- [ ] No duplicate functionality

### Testing Sequence:
1. `godot --path .` - Start game
2. `` ` `` - Open console
3. Test new commands
4. Click objects to inspect
5. `fps_status` - Check performance
6. `arch_status` - Verify harmony

## üåà THE DREAM CONTINUES

Every line of code serves the 2-year vision. Every bug becomes evolution. Every script is part of the universal being that can become anything.

**Remember**: We're not just building a game - we're creating the dream you've carried for two years. Make every commit worthy of that vision.
