## Ground Contact Sequence

1. HEEL STRIKE       2. FOOT FLAT        3. MIDSTANCE
   
   Heel↓                Heel■ Foot↓         Heel■ Foot■
   ====                 ==========          ==========
   Ground               Ground              Ground

4. HEEL OFF          5. TOE OFF

## Joint Angles During Gait
```
STANCE PHASE:
Ankle: Dorsiflexion → Neutral → Plantarflexion
       (-20°)      → (0°)    → (+30°)

SWING PHASE:
Ankle: Plantarflexion → Dorsiflexion → Dorsiflexion
       (+30°)        → (-10°)      → (-20°)
```

## Force Application Points
```
Heel Strike:  Impact absorption at heel
Midstance:    Vertical support through foot center
Toe Off:      Push-off force at toe tips
```

## Multi-Contact Benefits
- More stable ground contact
- Natural weight distribution
- Realistic rolling motion
- Better push-off power
- Improved balance control
