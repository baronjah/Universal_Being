# 🎯 Master Task List - January 28, 2025
*All wishes and whims from today's session - organized by priority*

## 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY (Must Fix Today)

### 1. Tutorial System Repair
**Issue**: Test button executable error, Tab key conflicts
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix tutorial test button command execution
- [ ] Add F1 key as alternative console access when UI is open
- [ ] Redesign tutorial with scenario-based testing instead of random commands
- [ ] Create logical test paths: Ragdoll → Astral → Scene → Integration

### 2. Astral Being Command Fix
**Issue**: `astral_being` command fails with "Failed to create being through Floodgate"
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Debug floodgate connection for astral beings
- [ ] Test perfect_astral_being.gd integration
- [ ] Verify astral being manager registration
- [ ] Ensure astral beings appear and respond to commands

### 3. Game Rules Spam Control
**Issue**: Rules system ignoring 20-object limit, crashing FPS to 9.0
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add object count checking BEFORE spawning
- [ ] Implement FPS-based spawning limits (stop if FPS < 30)
- [ ] Fix game_rules.txt execution to respect limits
- [ ] Test with controlled object spawning

### 4. Object Inspector UI Fix
**Issue**: UI partially cut off, not fully visible
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Ensure entire inspector interface fits on screen
- [ ] Add scrolling if needed for smaller screens
- [ ] Test all inspector buttons and functions
- [ ] Make inspector properly closeable

## 🔧 HIGH PRIORITY (Important for Usability)

### 5. Console Command Audit
**Issue**: Only 10-20 commands actually work vs 50+ listed
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Go through each command in help systematically
- [ ] Remove broken commands from help display
- [ ] Fix core working commands to be more reliable
- [ ] Create "working commands only" help section

### 6. Help Command Organization
**Issue**: Help text disorganized, commands mixed between segments
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Separate into clear categories (Ragdoll, Astral, Scene, System)
- [ ] Remove non-working commands from display
- [ ] Add test_tutorial to help prominently
- [ ] Sort commands logically within categories

### 7. Walking Ragdoll Improvements
**Issue**: Current ragdoll works but needs polish
**Current State**: ✅ Can walk, jump, move (this is actually good!)
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Improve movement responsiveness
- [ ] Better walking animation
- [ ] More reliable jump mechanics
- [ ] Enhanced interaction with objects

## 🎮 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Polish & Enhancement)

### 8. Floodgate Performance Optimization
**Issue**: "Floodgate unloads queue overflow: 215"
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Optimize queue processing algorithms
- [ ] Better load balancing for object creation/destruction
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup procedures
- [ ] Monitor and limit queue sizes

### 9. Universal Being Integration
**Issue**: Multiple universal being files need consolidation
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Use perfect_astral_being.gd as standard
- [ ] Connect to universal_thing.gd system
- [ ] Ensure LOD system works with beings
- [ ] Test consciousness and connection systems

### 10. Scene Management Polish
**Issue**: Scene system works but needs refinement
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Better save/load feedback
- [ ] Scene thumbnail previews
- [ ] Auto-save functionality
- [ ] Scene organization system

## 🐛 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

### 11. Birds/Flying Entities
**Issue**: Birds need improvement
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix bird spawning and behavior
- [ ] Integrate with astral being system
- [ ] Add bird-ragdoll interactions

### 12. Performance Monitoring
**Issue**: Performance warnings need better handling
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Smarter FPS optimization triggers
- [ ] Better memory management
- [ ] Performance statistics display

## 📋 TESTING STRATEGY

### Daily Testing Protocol:
1. **Launch game**
2. **Run `test_tutorial`** - See what actually works
3. **Test core functions**: `spawn_ragdoll`, `walk`, `clear`, `box`
4. **Check FPS impact** - Monitor object count vs performance
5. **Report results** - What works, what's broken, what's changed

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Tutorial system works without errors
- [ ] Astral beings spawn and respond to commands
- [ ] Object count stays under 20 unless explicitly requested
- [ ] All UI elements visible and functional
- [ ] Help command shows only working commands
- [ ] Console accessible even when UI is open

## 🎯 THE ULTIMATE GOAL

**"Perfect Console Creation Game"**
- Every command works reliably
- Clear feedback for all actions
- Ragdolls, astrals, and objects interact smoothly
- Tutorial system guides users through all features
- Performance stays stable under normal use

## 💡 REMEMBER

**Quality over Quantity**: Better to have 15 commands that work perfectly than 50 that mostly don't work.

**User Experience First**: Every feature should feel solid and responsive.

**Test Everything**: Use the tutorial system to verify each change.
