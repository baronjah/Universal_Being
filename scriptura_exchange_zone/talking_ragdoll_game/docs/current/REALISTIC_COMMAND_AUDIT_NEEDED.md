# 🔍 Realistic Command Audit - What Actually Works

Based on user feedback: **Only 10-20 commands truly work**, not the 50+ listed in help.

## 📋 Commands That We Know Work:
1. `clear` - Successfully cleared 374 objects
2. `help` - Shows command list (even if many don't work)
3. Basic ragdoll movement commands (walking, jumping work)

## ❌ Commands That Are Broken:
1. `astral_being` - "Failed to create being through Floodgate"
2. `astral` - Same failure
3. Many others listed in help but not functional

## 🎯 Tomorrow's REAL Priority:

### 1. Command Audit
Go through each command in the help list and test:
- Does it actually execute?
- Does it do what it claims?
- Does it give proper feedback?

### 2. Focus on Core Functionality
Instead of having 50+ broken commands, let's have **10-20 perfect commands**:

**Essential Commands (Must Work)**:
- `spawn_ragdoll` - Create working ragdoll
- `clear` - Remove objects (already works)
- `box`, `tree`, `rock` - Basic object spawning
- `walk`, `jump` - Ragdoll movement (partially working)
- `ground` - Restore ground
- `save/load` - Scene persistence
- `astral_spawn` - Create astral being (fix this)
- `help` - Show only working commands
- `system_status` - Check what's working
- `tutorial` - Step-by-step testing

**Advanced Commands (If Time)**:
- Object manipulation commands
- Physics adjustments
- Scene management

### 3. Clean Up Help Command
Remove all non-working commands from help list. Better to show 15 working commands than 50 broken ones.

### 4. Honest Status Reporting
Each command should report honestly:
- "Command executed successfully"
- "Command failed: [specific reason]"
- "Feature not yet implemented"

## 💡 Philosophy Shift:
**Quality over Quantity** - A small number of commands that work perfectly is infinitely better than many commands that don't work.

## 🎮 The Real Goal:
Make the console creation game feel **solid and responsive** with reliable commands that do what they promise.
