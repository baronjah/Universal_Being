# NPC State-Action System Design

## 🎯 Your Core Concept Analysis

### **Key Insights from Your Description**:
1. **States are persistent** - NPCs maintain states (walking, idle, attacking)
2. **Actions can interrupt** - External actions (attack) affect current state
3. **Physics-based responses** - Impact direction affects wobble/recovery
4. **State transitions** - Actions cause state changes, new interactions possible
5. **Bidirectional interactions** - Both NPCs can affect each other

This is a **Finite State Machine (FSM) with Physics Integration** - very professional approach!

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **State-Action Relationship**:
```
State (What NPC is doing) + Action (What happens to NPC) = New State + Physics Response
```

### **Example from Your Description**:
```
NPC1: Walking State + Attack Action (from NPC2) = Wobbling State + Calculate Impact Physics
NPC2: Attacking State + Impact Successful = Return to Idle/Walking State
```

## 📋 State Categories

### **Basic States**:
- **Idle** - Standing, looking around, breathing
- **Walking** - Moving to destination
- **Running** - Fast movement
- **Wobbling** - Recovering from impact
- **Falling** - Physics taking over
- **Getting Up** - Recovery sequence

### **Interaction States**:
- **Attacking** - Performing attack action
- **Defending** - Blocking or dodging
- **Talking** - Dialogue interaction
- **Investigating** - Looking at something
- **Following** - Tracking another NPC

### **Physics States**:
- **Stable** - Balanced on feet
- **Unbalanced** - Wobbling but recovering
- **Airborne** - Not touching ground
- **Knocked Down** - On ground, need to get up

## 🎮 Action System

### **Internal Actions** (NPC decides):
- **StartWalking** - Begin movement
- **Attack** - Initiate attack
- **Speak** - Start dialogue
- **LookAt** - Focus on target

### **External Actions** (Forced by environment/other NPCs):
- **TakeImpact** - Receive force from attack/collision
- **Interrupt** - Stop current action
- **Knockdown** - Fall to ground
- **Push** - Small displacement

## ⚙️ Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Basic State Machine**
```gdscript
# NPC State Machine
enum NPCState {
    IDLE,
    WALKING, 
    WOBBLING,
    ATTACKING,
    TALKING,
    FALLING,
    GETTING_UP
}

class_name NPCStateMachine
var current_state: NPCState = NPCState.IDLE
var previous_state: NPCState = NPCState.IDLE
var state_timer: float = 0.0
var can_transition: bool = true
```

### **Phase 2: Action Processing**
```gdscript
# Action System
enum ActionType {
    WALK_TO,
    ATTACK_TARGET,
    TAKE_IMPACT,
    START_DIALOGUE,
    INVESTIGATE
}

class_name NPCAction
var type: ActionType
var target: Vector3  # Position or direction
var source: Node     # What caused this action
var force: float     # For physics actions
var data: Dictionary # Extra parameters
```

### **Phase 3: Physics Integration**
```gdscript
# Impact Response (Your Example)
func handle_take_impact(action: NPCAction):
    var impact_direction = action.target.normalized()
    var impact_force = action.force
    
    # Calculate wobble response
    if current_state == NPCState.WALKING:
        # Still walking, but wobble
        transition_to_state(NPCState.WOBBLING)
        apply_wobble_physics(impact_direction, impact_force)
        
        # Plan return to walking
        wobble_recovery_timer = calculate_recovery_time(impact_force)
```

## 🔄 State Transition Logic

### **Your Scenario Implementation**:
```gdscript
# Scenario: Walking NPC gets attacked
func process_attack_on_walking_npc():
    # NPC1 State: Walking
    npc1.current_state = NPCState.WALKING
    
    # NPC2 Action: Attack
    var attack_action = NPCAction.new()
    attack_action.type = ActionType.ATTACK_TARGET
    attack_action.target = npc1.global_position
    attack_action.source = npc2
    attack_action.force = 5.0
    
    # Impact Processing
    npc1.receive_action(attack_action)
    
    # Result: NPC1 transitions to wobbling
    # Physics: Apply impact force in direction
    # Behavior: Try to maintain walking, but wobble
```

### **State Transition Rules**:
```gdscript
func can_transition_to(new_state: NPCState) -> bool:
    match current_state:
        NPCState.IDLE:
            return true  # Can transition to any state
        NPCState.WALKING:
            # Can be interrupted by impacts, but not by voluntary actions
            match new_state:
                NPCState.WOBBLING, NPCState.FALLING:
                    return true  # External forces
                NPCState.ATTACKING, NPCState.TALKING:
                    return false  # Can't voluntarily stop walking
        NPCState.WOBBLING:
            # Must complete wobble before new actions
            match new_state:
                NPCState.WALKING, NPCState.IDLE:
                    return wobble_recovery_complete
                NPCState.FALLING:
                    return true  # Can fall if wobble fails
```

## 🎭 Text-Based Prototype

### **Simple Text Implementation** (Testing Phase):
```gdscript
# Text-based state visualization
func describe_interaction():
    print("=== NPC Interaction Scenario ===")
    print("NPC1: Currently WALKING towards market")
    print("NPC2: Approaches and performs ATTACK action")
    print("")
    print("Impact Processing:")
    print("- Impact direction: ", impact_vector)
    print("- Impact force: ", impact_strength)
    print("- NPC1 stability: ", stability_factor)
    print("")
    print("Result:")
    print("NPC1: Transitions from WALKING to WOBBLING")
    print("- Still moving forward, but unstable")
    print("- Physics: Apply lateral force")
    print("- Timer: 2.3 seconds to recover")
    print("")
    print("New possible interactions:")
    print("- NPC1 can be knocked down if hit again")
    print("- NPC1 can recover and continue walking")
    print("- NPC2 can attack again or move away")
```
