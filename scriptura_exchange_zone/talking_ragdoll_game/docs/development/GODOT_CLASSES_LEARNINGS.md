## üîç Key Discoveries

### The Professional Way:
```
Skeleton3D
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PhysicalBoneSimulator3D (manages all physics)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PhysicalBone3D (auto-created per bone)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SpringBoneSimulator3D (soft dynamics)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SkeletonIK3D (foot placement)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AnimationTree (state management)
```

### Why It's Better Than Our Current System:
