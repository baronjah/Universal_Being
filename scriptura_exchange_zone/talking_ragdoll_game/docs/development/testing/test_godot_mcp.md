# Godot MCP Test Commands

## Quick Test Sequence

Once you start the new Claude Code session in this directory, ask Claude:

1. **"Get the Godot version"**
   - Should return your installed Godot version

2. **"Launch the Godot editor for this project"**
   - Should open the Godot editor with this project

3. **"Run the project and show me the console output"**
   - Should run the game and capture all console messages

4. **"List all Godot projects in the parent directory"**
   - Should find other Godot projects nearby

5. **"Get detailed project info"**
   - Should show project structure, autoloads, scenes

## Expected Console Output

When the project runs, look for:

âœ… Universal Entity messages:
```
[UNIVERSAL] Entity spawned! I am everything and nothing.
[UNIVERSAL] Current satisfaction: 100%
```

âœ… Console initialization:
```
[CONSOLE] Initializing with 50+ commands
[FILTER] Spam filter initialized
[FLOODGATE] System ready
```

âœ… No red errors (all should be fixed)
