# üó∫Ô∏è NEXT SESSION ROADMAP
## Tomorrow's Adventure Plan

### üéØ **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES**

#### 1. **Asset Creator Evolution** üé®
```bash
# What to enhance:
- More shape options (torus, capsule, custom meshes)
- Material properties (roughness, metallic, emission)
- Animation presets (rotate, bounce, pulse)
- Size presets (tiny, small, normal, large, massive)
- Physics presets (bouncy, sticky, slippery, magnetic)
```

#### 2. **Universal Being Interface Revolution** üß¨
```bash
# Transform beings into functional UI:
being create inspector_ui 0 3 0      # Creates floating UI being
being transform ui_1 color_picker    # Transform into color interface
being transform ui_2 asset_browser   # Transform into asset library browser
being transform ui_3 physics_panel   # Transform into physics controls
```

#### 3. **Viewport-Aware 3D UI Implementation** üëÅÔ∏è
```bash
# Use the math from viewport_info and camera_rays:
- Position UI beings at perfect distances from camera
- Scale UI based on FOV and resolution
- Auto-hide UI when looking away
- Depth-based UI layering
```

### üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION TASKS**

#### **A. Asset Creator 2.0**
- [ ] Add material editor with PBR properties
- [ ] Implement preview with real-time cosmic colors
- [ ] Add animation curve editor
- [ ] Create asset library browser integration
- [ ] Add export/import for asset sharing

#### **B. Universal Being UI System**
- [ ] Create being-to-UI transformation templates
- [ ] Implement UI component library (buttons, sliders, panels)
- [ ] Add click-and-drag interaction for UI beings
- [ ] Create UI layout system (grid, stack, flow)

#### **C. LOD Debug System**
- [ ] Free camera mode with WASD controls
- [ ] Real-time LOD visualization (colored wireframes)
- [ ] Distance-based object culling
- [ ] Performance metrics overlay

### üéÆ **COMMANDS TO IMPLEMENT**

#### **Asset Creator Enhancement**
```bash
asset_editor <name>        # Edit existing assets
material_editor           # PBR material creation
animation_editor          # Create object animations
physics_editor            # Advanced physics properties
```

#### **UI Being System**
```bash
ui_being create <type>    # Create functional UI beings
ui_transform <being> <ui> # Transform being into UI component
ui_layout <pattern>       # Arrange UI beings in patterns
ui_hide_all              # Hide all UI beings
ui_show_all              # Show all UI beings
```

#### **Debug & Analysis**
```bash
free_camera             # Enter free flight camera mode
lod_debug <on/off>      # Toggle LOD visualization
performance_overlay     # Show real-time performance metrics
memory_usage            # Display memory and object counts
```

### üåü **CREATIVE FEATURES**

#### **Universal Being Behaviors**
- **Curiosity System** - Beings investigate new objects
- **Learning Memory** - Beings remember interactions
- **Social Behaviors** - Beings interact with each other
- **Evolution System** - Beings adapt based on environment

#### **Cosmic Environment**
- **Day/Night Cycle** - Affects cosmic color spectrum
- **Weather System** - Rain, snow, wind affect physics
- **Gravity Zones** - Different gravity strengths in areas
- **Dimensional Portals** - Beings can travel between zones

### üîÆ **LONG-TERM VISION**

#### **The Ultimate Goal: Living Universe**
1. **Self-Evolving Beings** - Create, modify, and optimize themselves
2. **Emergent Behaviors** - Unexpected interactions and patterns
3. **Player as God** - Guide evolution but don't control everything
4. **Infinite Creativity** - Endless combinations of forms and behaviors

#### **Technical Mastery**
1. **Perfect LOD** - Seamless performance at any scale
2. **Infinite Worlds** - Procedural generation + being evolution
3. **AI Integration** - Beings with actual intelligence
4. **VR Ready** - 3D UI system perfect for VR interaction

### üìã **SESSION PREPARATION CHECKLIST**

#### **Before Next Session:**
- [ ] Test `asset_creator` - verify cosmic spectrum works
- [ ] Test `viewport_info` and `camera_rays` - understand the math
- [ ] Experiment with `being create` variations
- [ ] Try creating custom assets and verify persistence
- [ ] Test bouncy cube physics interactions

#### **Files to Focus On:**
- `asset_creator_panel.gd` - Enhance with new features
- `universal_being.gd` - Add UI transformation capabilities  
- `console_manager.gd` - Add new command categories
- `standardized_objects.gd` - Expand asset library

#### **Key Questions to Explore:**
1. How can Universal Beings become functional UI components?
2. What's the best way to position 3D UI relative to camera?
3. How to make asset creation more intuitive and powerful?
4. What LOD system would work best for this project?
