# Fixes Applied - May 28, 2025

## Fixed Issues

### 1. UnifiedBeingSystem Class/Autoload Conflict ✅
**Error:** `Class "UnifiedBeingSystem" hides an autoload singleton`
**Fix:** Removed `class_name UnifiedBeingSystem` declaration, keeping only `extends Node`
**Result:** Script now loads properly as autoload

### 2. Debug Print Assignment Error ✅
**Error:** `Invalid assignment of property or key 'debug_print' with value of type 'Callable'`
**Fix:** Removed attempt to override method with callable in `debug_integration_patch.gd`
**Result:** No more errors on startup

### 3. Floodgate Execute Command Missing ✅
**Error:** `Nonexistent function 'execute_command' in base 'Node (floodgate_controller.gd)'`
**Fix:** Changed to use `second_dimensional_magic()` method which is the correct floodgate API
**Result:** Objects now create properly through floodgate

### 4. Asset Creator UI Improvements ✅
**Issue:** UI elements cut off, can't see save button
**Fixes Applied:**
- Added ScrollContainer to make content scrollable
- Changed ColorPicker to ColorPickerButton for space saving
- UI now fits in window with all controls accessible

## Remaining Issues to Address

### Console Spam
The game rules system appears to be automatically spawning trees and boxes repeatedly. The rules file shows "PAUSED" but something is still triggering spawns. Need to investigate:
- Rule execution system
- Automatic spawn triggers
- Performance optimization triggers

### Performance
- FPS dropping to 1.0 triggers emergency optimization
- Multiple objects being created automatically
- Need to find and disable automatic spawning

## Commands Now Working

✅ `leaf` - Creates leaf objects
✅ `wall` - Creates wall objects  
✅ `stick` - Creates stick objects
✅ `tree` - Creates trees
✅ `asset_creator` - Opens asset creation UI
✅ `assets` - Lists all available assets
✅ `clear` - Clears spawned objects
✅ `debug` - Toggles debug display

## Next Steps

1. Find source of automatic tree/box spawning
2. Implement proper debug filtering to reduce console spam
3. Add scene creator with skeleton points
4. Optimize performance for large numbers of objects

The core systems are now working properly - just need to track down the automatic spawning issue to reduce the console spam and improve performance.
