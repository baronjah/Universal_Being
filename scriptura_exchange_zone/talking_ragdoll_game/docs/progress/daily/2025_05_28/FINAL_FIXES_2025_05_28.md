# Final Fixes Applied - May 28, 2025

## Major Issues Resolved âœ…

### 1. Custom Asset Creation & Spawning
**Problem:** Created assets (like sphere_test) couldn't be spawned
**Solution:** 
- Enhanced `_cmd_create` to check StandardizedObjects definitions first
- Now works with ANY asset in the asset catalog, including custom-created ones
- Usage: `create sphere_test` (or whatever you named your asset)

### 2. Automatic Tree/Box Spam Eliminated
**Problem:** Game rules system was automatically spawning trees and boxes every few seconds
**Solution:**
- Added `rules_enabled: bool = false` flag to ListsViewerSystem
- Rules are now disabled by default
- Added `rules` console command to toggle: `rules on`, `rules off`, or just `rules` to toggle

### 3. Console Spam Reduction
**Result:** Should now see dramatically less spam in console
- No more automatic `[SPAWN] Created tree through Universal Object Manager`
- No more automatic `[RULE] game_rules.txt_X executed` messages
- Much cleaner console experience

## Available Commands Now Working

### Asset Creation
- `create <asset_name>` - Create any asset from the catalog
- `create sphere_test` - Your custom reddish sphere
- `create stick` - Should work now 
- `create wall` - Working
- `create leaf` - Working

### System Control
- `rules` - Toggle automatic rule execution
- `rules off` - Disable automatic spawning (should be off by default)
- `rules on` - Re-enable if you want the automatic behavior
- `asset_creator` - Open the asset creation UI
- `assets` - List all available assets

### Debug Control
- `debug` - Toggle debug visualization
- All the existing commands still work

## Testing Your Custom Asset

1. Try: `create sphere_test`
2. Should spawn your reddish sphere at mouse position
3. If it doesn't appear, the object might be spawning but not visible due to:
   - Camera position
   - Object size/position
   - Material issues

## Next Steps to Test

1. **Test custom asset**: `create sphere_test`
2. **Test rule control**: `rules off` (should stop any remaining spam)
3. **Test other assets**: `create stick`, `create wall`, etc.
4. **Verify spam reduction**: Console should be much quieter now

## Remaining Issues to Investigate

If objects still don't appear:
- Camera might need adjusting
- Objects might be spawning outside view
- Floodgate queue processing might have delays
- Need to check StandardizedObjects mesh creation

The core systems should now work much better with far less spam and proper asset creation support!
