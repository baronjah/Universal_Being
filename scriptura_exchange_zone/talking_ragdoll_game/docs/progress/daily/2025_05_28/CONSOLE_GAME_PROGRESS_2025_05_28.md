# Console Game Progress - May 28, 2025

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Debug Toggle System ✅
- Created `DebugManager` to control console spam
- Added debug categories for filtering output
- Integrated with existing systems via `DebugIntegrationPatch`
- Console commands: `debug`, `spam` to control verbosity
- Reduced spam from 10k lines to manageable output

### 2. System Consolidation ✅
- Created `UnifiedBeingSystem` to replace:
  - 5+ versions of astral beings
  - 3 versions of universal beings
  - Multiple bird implementations
- All beings now use a single unified system
- Transform any being into any other type
- Console commands: `being`, `beings`, `transform`

### 3. New Simple Assets Added ✅
- Added to StandardizedObjects:
  - **wall** - Static building element (4x3x0.3m)
  - **stick** - Physics-enabled cylinder (0.1x1x0.1m)
  - **leaf** - Lightweight physics object (0.3x0.01x0.2m)
- Console commands: `wall`, `stick`, `leaf`
- All integrated with Floodgate system

### 4. In-Game Asset Creator ✅
- Created `AssetCreatorPanel` UI for dynamic asset creation
- Features:
  - Name, type, shape, color, size customization
  - Live 3D preview
  - Category and tag system
  - Automatic integration with game systems
- Console commands: `asset_creator`, `assets`
- Assets created in-game immediately available via `create` command

## Working Assets

### Simple Assets (Confirmed Working)
- rock, tree, fruit, ramp, path, bush, box, ball
- wall, stick, leaf (newly added)

### Complex Entities (Unified)
- All beings now use UnifiedBeingSystem
- Can transform between types dynamically

## Next Steps

### 5. Scene Creator (Pending)
- Build scenes from created assets
- Add skeleton points for ragdoll generation
- Save/load scene configurations

## Console Commands Summary

### Debug Control
- `debug` - Show debug status
- `debug all` - Enable all debug output
- `debug none` - Disable all debug except errors
- `debug <category> on/off` - Control specific category
- `spam` - Toggle general console spam

### Asset Creation
- `create <asset_name>` - Create any asset

## Architecture Improvements

1. **Floodgate Integration** - All creation goes through thread-safe queue
2. **Unified Systems** - Single point of control for each feature
3. **Debug Control** - Fine-grained control over console output
4. **Dynamic Assets** - Create new assets without coding

## User Experience Improvements

- Console spam reduced from 10k to ~100 lines
- Simple commands for all actions
- Visual asset creator for non-coders
- Everything is a Universal Being that can transform
