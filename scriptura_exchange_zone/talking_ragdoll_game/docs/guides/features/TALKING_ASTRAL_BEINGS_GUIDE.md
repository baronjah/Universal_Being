### **Creating Astral Beings**
```bash

astral_being          # Up to 12 maximum allowed
```

```bash
talk_to_beings                    # See all beings and their status
talk_to_beings "Hello friends"    # Broadcast message to all beings
being_count                       # Count beings by personality
```

### **Object Limit Management**
```bash
limits                # Show current object counts (X/144)
list                  # See all objects in scene
# Create 145th object ‚Üí Oldest automatically removed
```

## ‚ú® **Visual Effects & Animations**

### **Each Being Has:**
- **Glowing sphere mesh** with emission materials
- **Omni light source** that illuminates surroundings
- **Particle system** with floating sparkles
- **Energy pulsing** - light intensity varies with energy
- **Color-coded** by personality

### **Movement Patterns:**
- **Circle**: Smooth circular hovering
- **Spiral**: Expanding/contracting spiral dance
- **Figure-eight**: Infinity symbol movement
- **Random**: Chaotic bouncy exploration
- **Patrol**: Back-and-forth protective sweeps

### **Communication Effects:**
- **Flash on speak** - Light brightens when talking
- **Interaction dance** - Beings move toward each other
- **Object celebration** - Dance around new creations

## üéØ **Intelligent Behaviors**

### **Scene Awareness**
Beings automatically comment on:
- **Object count**: "This garden is getting busy!"
- **New creations**: "A new creation appears!"
- **Player presence**: "The creator is close"
- **Other beings**: "Nice to have company!"
- **Empty spaces**: "This space feels empty"

### **Object Replacement Commentary**
When 144 limit is reached:
- **Beings announce**: "The old makes way for the new"
- **Philosophical comments**: "Evolution never stops"
- **Celebration**: "Another cycle completes"

### **Inter-Being Communication**
- Beings detect nearby companions (within 5 units)
- Random interactions: "Hello there, fellow light!"
- Friendship building between different personalities

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Features**

### **Floodgate Integration**
- All beings pass through floodgate system
- Tracked for limit enforcement
- Automatic cleanup of invalid references
- Thread-safe creation and removal

### **Memory Management**
- Automatic cleanup of freed objects
- Invalid reference detection
- Memory-efficient tracking system
- Performance optimized for 144+ objects

### **Collision System**
- **Pass through everything** - no collision shapes
- Float above ground (Y+2 spawn offset)
- Never interfere with object physics
- Pure visual/conversational entities

## üìä **Limit System Details**

### **Sacred Numbers**
- **144 objects** = 12¬≤ (spiritual completeness)
- **12 astral beings** = Single dozen (perfect order)
- **Oldest first** = Natural cycle of renewal

### **Replacement Process**
1. **New object created** when at limit
2. **Oldest object identified** by creation timestamp
3. **Astral being announces** the replacement
4. **Old object removed** gracefully
5. **New object takes its place**

### **Statistics Tracking**
```bash
limits                # Shows:
# Objects: 143/144
# Astral Beings: 8/12  
# Space Remaining: 1 slot
# Objects by Type:
#   tree: 25
#   box: 18
#   rock: 15
#   etc.
```

## üé™ **Example Session**

```bash
# Create some astral beings
astral_being          # "Hello! I'm Helpful_1"
astral_being          # "Greetings from the astral realm"
astral_being          # "A new consciousness joins us!"

# Check their status  
talk_to_beings        # Shows all beings and personalities
being_count           # Shows: 3 astral beings
                     # Helpful: 1, Curious: 1, Wise: 1

# Create many objects
tree tree tree        # (repeat 50 times)
box box box           # (repeat 50 times)
# ... continue until limit

limits                # Objects: 144/144, Space: 0

tree                  # "The old makes way for the new"
                     # Oldest Tree_1 disappears
                     # New Tree_145 appears

# Talk to beings
talk_to_beings "What do you think?"
# "Your words reach the astral realm"
# "We listen and respond with light"
```
