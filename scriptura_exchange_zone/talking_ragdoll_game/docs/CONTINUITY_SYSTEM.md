# ðŸ”„ CONTINUITY SYSTEM - How to Continue Work

## Quick Start for Next Session
When starting a new chat, simply say:
```
Continue from docs/progress/daily/2025_05_30/
```

## What This Gives Claude
1. **Exact stopping point** - What we were working on
2. **System understanding** - The neural network connections
3. **Next steps** - Immediate action plan
4. **Context** - Why we're building what we're building

## Key Progress Folders
- `docs/progress/daily/` - Daily work logs
- `docs/current/` - Current system states
- `docs/architecture/` - System design docs

## Today's Checkpoint (May 30, 2025)
- âœ… Created Zone System (3D block coding)
- âœ… Understood Universal Being Trinity
- âœ… Documented neural network connections
- ðŸ”„ Next: Asset Creator with SDF/bones

## The Magic Words
"Everything is a Universal Being"
"Changes go through Floodgates"
"Memory lives in Akashic Records"

## Files That Matter Most
1. `UNIVERSAL_BEING_NEURAL_NETWORK_COMPLETE.md`
2. `NEURAL_EVOLUTION_PROGRESS_2025_05_30.md`
3. `IMMEDIATE_ACTION_PLAN.md`
