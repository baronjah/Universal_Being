## üîß New Console Commands Added

### Floodgate Diagnostics
- `floodgate` - Show floodgate system status and queue sizes
- `queues` - Alias for floodgate command
- `healthcheck` - Run comprehensive system health check
- `systems` - Show status of all autoload systems
- `floodtest` - Test floodgate system with sample operations

### Enhanced Object Commands
All object creation commands now use floodgate:
- `tree`, `rock`, `box`, `ball`, `ramp` - Enhanced with floodgate integration
- `clear` - Safe deletion through floodgate
- `delete <name>` - Safe object removal
- `list` - Enhanced object listing with validity checks

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Safety

### Graceful Degradation
- **Floodgate unavailable**: Falls back to direct operations
- **System missing**: Clear error messages and alternative paths
- **Invalid operations**: Logged but don't crash system
- **Startup issues**: Comprehensive diagnostic reporting

### Thread Safety
- **Mutex protection**: All operations use Eden-style mutexes
- **Try-lock patterns**: Non-blocking operations prevent deadlocks
- **Queue management**: Controlled processing with limits
- **Memory tracking**: Automatic cleanup when thresholds reached

### Diagnostic Features
- **Health monitoring**: Real-time system status checks
- **Error reporting**: Detailed error logs with context
- **Performance tracking**: Queue sizes and processing times
- **Startup diagnostics**: Complete system verification

## üéØ Key Problems Solved

### ‚úÖ **Console Errors Fixed**
1. **Autoload dependencies**: Proper initialization sequence
2. **Missing systems**: Graceful fallbacks and error handling
3. **Thread safety**: All operations now mutex-protected
4. **System readiness**: Wait for systems before operations

### ‚úÖ **Object Spawning Issues Fixed**
1. **Floating objects**: Fixed spawn height from 10.0 to 0.0
2. **Creation failures**: Enhanced error handling and logging
3. **Unsafe operations**: All creation goes through floodgate
4. **Memory leaks**: Proper cleanup and tracking

### ‚úÖ **System Integration Fixed**
1. **Architecture consistency**: Eden pattern throughout
2. **Centralized control**: All operations through floodgate
3. **Comprehensive logging**: File-based logs with script tracking
4. **Asset management**: Player approval and cataloging

## üöÄ Ready to Use Features
