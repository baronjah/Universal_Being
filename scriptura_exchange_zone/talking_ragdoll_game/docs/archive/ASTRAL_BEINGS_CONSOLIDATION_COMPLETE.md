# Astral Beings Consolidation Complete

## Date: 2025-05-24

### What Was Done

Successfully consolidated three separate astral being systems into one unified system:

1. **Unified System**: `talking_astral_being.gd`
   - Combined all features from the three systems
   - Added personalities (HELPFUL, CURIOUS, WISE, PLAYFUL, GUARDIAN)
   - Movement modes (FREE_FLIGHT, ORBITING, CREATING, FOLLOWING, ASSISTING, HOVERING)
   - Assistance modes (RAGDOLL_SUPPORT, OBJECT_MANIPULATION, SCENE_ORGANIZATION, ENVIRONMENTAL_HARMONY, CREATIVE_ASSISTANCE)
   - Energy system with drain/regeneration
   - Connection awareness
   - Blinking behaviors
   - Infinity pattern creation mode
   - Full conversation system

2. **Files Updated**:
   - `standardized_objects.gd` - Now uses `talking_astral_being.gd` instead of `astral_being_enhanced.gd`
   - `main_game_controller.gd` - Disabled old astral beings setup
   - `scene_setup.gd` - Disabled old astral beings setup
   - `world_builder.gd` - Already using the new system (no changes needed)

3. **Old Systems (Now Deprecated)**:
   - `astral_beings.gd` - Original manager system (disabled)
   - `astral_being_enhanced.gd` - Enhanced individual system (no longer used)
   - Both files kept for reference but not loaded anywhere
