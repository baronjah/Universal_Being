## üéÆ Ready to Run!

The project should now launch without errors. The JSH framework integration needs some adaptation since container and datapoint systems were designed for the original D: drive project structure, but the core logic is there.

## üìù Notes for Next Steps

The container and datapoint systems from JSH will need translation to work with the current ragdoll game structure. These systems provide:
- Dynamic node creation and management
- Data persistence and state tracking
- Hierarchical organization

Consider creating simplified versions that match the ragdoll game's needs while maintaining the powerful organizational concepts from JSH.
