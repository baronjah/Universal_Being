# Console UI Rendering Fix - 2025-05-24

## Issue Fixed
The debug console was rendering in the 3D viewport instead of as a proper UI overlay.

## Root Cause
The console_container was being added directly to the scene tree root:
```gdscript
get_tree().root.call_deferred("add_child", console_container)
```

This caused it to render in 3D space alongside game objects.

## Solution Applied
Modified `console_manager.gd` to use a CanvasLayer:
```gdscript
# Add to scene via CanvasLayer for proper UI rendering
var canvas_layer = CanvasLayer.new()
canvas_layer.name = "ConsoleCanvasLayer"
canvas_layer.layer = 110  # Higher than debug panel to ensure console is on top
get_tree().root.call_deferred("add_child", canvas_layer)
canvas_layer.call_deferred("add_child", console_container)
```

## Additional Notes
- The CanvasLayer ensures UI elements render on top of the 3D scene
- Layer 110 was chosen to be higher than the DebugCanvasLayer (layer 100)
- This follows the same pattern used by the mouse_interaction_system for its debug panel

## Testing Steps
1. Run the game
2. Press Tab to toggle the console
3. Console should now appear as a proper overlay on top of the 3D scene
4. It should not interfere with 3D object rendering

## Related Systems
- `mouse_interaction_system.gd` uses a similar CanvasLayer approach for debug panel
- `ui_settings_manager.gd` manages console positioning and sizing
- Console can be toggled with Tab key or closed with Escape

## Next Steps if Issues Persist
1. Check if the console_container visibility is being properly toggled
2. Verify the CanvasLayer is actually being created and added
3. Check for any conflicting UI elements or layers
4. Review the animation/tween system for the console toggle
