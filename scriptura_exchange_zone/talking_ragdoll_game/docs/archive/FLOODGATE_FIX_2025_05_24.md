# Floodgate System Fix - May 24, 2025

## Issue: "Failed to add root node" Errors

### Problem
When creating objects (trees, birds, etc.), the console showed:
```
[ERROR] Failed to add root node: tree_1 (not re-queueing)
[ERROR] Failed to add root node: bird_1 (not re-queueing)
```

### Cause
The floodgate controller was trying to find nodes by name using `get_node_or_null()` after adding them to the tree. This failed because:
1. The node was just added and might not be immediately findable by path
2. The search was using just the node name, not the full path

### Fix Applied
In `scripts/core/floodgate_controller.gd`, lines 917-925:
- Removed the redundant node search after `add_child()`
- Now directly uses the node reference we already have for registration
- Simplified the logic and eliminated the error condition

### Result
Objects should now be created successfully through the floodgate system without errors.

## Additional Findings

### Vector5 Custom Type
- Found in `scripts/core/dimensional_ragdoll_system.gd`
- This is a custom class defined within the file for 5D positioning
- Components: x, y, z, w (emotion/time), v (consciousness)
- Part of the Eden-inspired dimensional magic system
- Working correctly as designed

### Debug Level Control
Previously implemented debug level controls in:
- `world_builder.gd` - Set to level 1 (errors only)
- `console_manager.gd` - Set to level 1 (errors only)

This reduces console spam while maintaining error visibility.

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Run the game
2. Press Tab to open console
3. Type `tree` or `bird` to create objects
4. Objects should now spawn without errors

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any new errors during object creation
- Test with various object types
- Verify floodgate queuing system works for all operations
