# Project Cleanup Summary - May 26, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Parse Error Fixed**
- **Issue:** `spawn_ragdoll_v2()` coroutine called without `await`
- **Fix:** Added `await` to coroutine call in ragdoll_v2_spawner.gd

### 2. **Console System Cleaned Up**
- **Issue:** Multiple conflicting console systems (JSHConsole vs ConsoleManager)
- **Fix:** Disabled JSHConsole, using only ConsoleManager
- **Result:** Tab key console toggle now works properly

### 3. **Test Command Conflicts Resolved**
- **Issue:** "test" command was overridden by threaded test system
- **Fix:** Renamed simple test commands to "simpletest" to avoid conflicts

### 4. **Ragdoll System Consolidated**
- **Issue:** Multiple broken ragdoll systems, biomechanical walker falling apart
- **Fix:** Created single `UnifiedBiomechanicalWalker` class
- **Features:**
  - ‚úÖ Proper joint constraints
  - ‚úÖ Three-element feet (heel, midfoot, toes)
  - ‚úÖ Stable physics with damping
  - ‚úÖ 4-phase gait cycle
  - ‚úÖ Color-coded body parts

## üéÆ New Console Commands

### Unified Walker Commands
```bash
spawn_walker              # Spawn at origin
spawn_walker 5 2 0        # Spawn at position (x, y, z)
walker_speed 1.5          # Set walk speed
walker_teleport 10 3 5    # Teleport walker
walker_info               # Show debug information
walker_destroy            # Remove walker
```

### Test Commands
```bash
simpletest               # Simple test command
hello world              # Hello test with arguments
```

### Layer Reality System (unchanged)
```bash
reality 0                # Text view
reality 1                # 2D map view
reality 2                # Debug 3D view
reality 3                # Full 3D view
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Tab:** Toggle console
- **F1-F4:** Switch reality layers

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/scripts/ragdoll/unified_biomechanical_walker.gd` - Clean, working walker
- `/scripts/patches/unified_walker_commands.gd` - Console commands
- `/scripts/patches/simple_console_test.gd` - Console debugging

### Modified Files
- `project.godot` - Updated autoloads, disabled JSHConsole
- `scripts/ragdoll_v2/ragdoll_v2_spawner.gd` - Fixed await syntax
- `scripts/patches/simple_console_test.gd` - Renamed test commands

## üöß Remaining Issues

### Object Inspector (Medium Priority)
- **Issue:** Object inspector not appearing after `setup_systems`
- **Location:** Mouse interaction system in main scene
- **Status:** Needs investigation of mouse system setup

### Old Ragdoll Systems (Low Priority)
- **Issue:** Multiple old ragdoll files still present
- **Suggestion:** Can be archived/removed once unified walker is confirmed working
- **Files:** Various ragdoll_*.gd files in different locations

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Launch Project**
   - Should load without parse errors
   - Console should be accessible with Tab key

2. **Test Console**
   ```bash
   simpletest        # Should show "IT WORKS!"
   hello world       # Should echo back arguments
   ```

3. **Test Walker**
   ```bash
   spawn_walker      # Should create stable ragdoll
   walker_info       # Should show debug information
   walker_speed 2.0  # Should change walking speed
   ```

4. **Test Layer System**
   - Press F1-F4 to switch reality layers
   - Use `reality 0-3` commands

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Test the new unified walker system
2. Verify console Tab toggle works
3. Confirm no more falling-apart physics

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
1. Fix object inspector mouse interaction
2. Test layer reality system visualization
3. Clean up old ragdoll files

### Long Term (Low Priority)
1. Add walker animation improvements
2. Enhance visual feedback systems
3. Optimize performance

## üîß Technical Notes

### Physics Settings
- Linear damping: 0.8 (prevents excessive movement)
- Angular damping: 3.0 (reduces wobbling)
- Joint limits: Anatomically realistic constraints
- Contact monitoring: Enabled for ground detection

### Console Architecture
- Primary: ConsoleManager (working)
- Disabled: JSHConsole (conflicting)
- Command registration: Multi-method fallback system

### Walker Features
- **Body:** Pelvis, spine, head with 6DOF joints
- **Legs:** Thigh, shin with hip/knee joints
- **Feet:** Heel, midfoot, toes with hinge joints
- **Gait:** 4-phase cycle (stance, lift, swing, plant)
- **Balance:** Active upright force and forward momentum
