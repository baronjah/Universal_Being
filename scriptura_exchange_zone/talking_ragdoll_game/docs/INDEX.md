## üåü Key Concepts

### Universal Being
Everything in the game is a Universal Being - a singular point that can become anything:
- Objects (trees, boxes, rocks)
- Interfaces (console, inspector, creator)
- Characters (ragdolls, astral beings)
- Effects (particles, lights)

### Floodgate Controller
The universal memory system that:
- Tracks all beings
- Manages transformations
- Handles connections
- Never forgets

### Eden Records
Blueprint-based system for:
- Interface definitions
- Interaction mappings
- Visual layouts
- Behavior scripts

### Console System
Primary interface featuring:
- 50+ commands
- Object creation
- System control
- Debug features
