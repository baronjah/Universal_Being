# Universal Being Mouse - Design Document

## üñ±Ô∏è Core Concept
The mouse cursor becomes a Universal Being that exists in the game world, capable of transforming and interacting with other Universal Beings.

## üéØ Vision Implementation

### **Mouse as Universal Being**
```gdscript
# The mouse Universal Being would have properties like:
- position (Vector2/Vector3) - current cursor position
- state (hovering, clicking, dragging, combo_preview)
- form (cursor, hand, pointer, custom_shape)
- interaction_radius (for detecting nearby beings)
- combo_chain (array of recent interactions)
```

### **Key Features**

1. **Dynamic State Changes**
   - Mouse Being changes form based on what it hovers over
   - Different visual representations for different interaction types
   - State affects how other Universal Beings react

2. **Combo System Integration**
   - As mouse moves, it builds combo chains with other beings
   - Preview system shows potential interactions before clicking
   - Visual feedback trails between interacting beings

3. **Universal Being Interactions**
   - Mouse Being can "touch" other beings just by proximity
   - Beings can react to mouse presence without clicks
   - Creates living, responsive interface

4. **Device Agnostic**
   - Easy to swap mouse for:
     - VR controllers (hand Universal Beings)
     - Touch input (finger Universal Beings)
     - Eye tracking (gaze Universal Being)
     - Voice commands (sound wave Universal Being)

## üîß Implementation Ideas

### **Universal Mouse Controller**
```gdscript
extends UniversalBeing
class_name UniversalMouseBeing

signal being_hovered(being: UniversalBeing)
signal combo_preview_updated(combo_chain: Array)
signal interaction_started(target: UniversalBeing)

var cursor_being_visual: Node3D
var interaction_particles: GPUParticles3D
var combo_preview_line: Line3D
```

### **Benefits**
1. **Consistent System** - Mouse follows same rules as all beings
2. **Rich Interactions** - Mouse can have properties, abilities, transformations
3. **Visual Feedback** - Mouse Being can emit particles, change colors, morph
4. **Future Proof** - Any input device just needs to control a Universal Being

### **Example Interactions**
- Mouse hovers over button ‚Üí Button Being glows, Mouse Being transforms to hand
- Mouse builds combo ‚Üí Trail of energy between beings shows interaction path
- Mouse clicks ‚Üí Spawns interaction particles, triggers being connections
- Mouse drags ‚Üí Creates temporary bond between beings

## üåü Tomorrow's Implementation Plan

1. Create `UniversalMouseBeing` class
2. Replace traditional mouse detection with being-to-being proximity
3. Add visual feedback system for hover states
4. Implement combo preview visualization
5. Connect to existing gizmo system through being interactions

This makes EVERYTHING truly universal - even the tools we use to interact are Universal Beings!
