# Testing Commands - Containers vs Zones

## üè† CONTAINERS (Rooms that connect - Universal Being spaces)
container               # Create container room
containers              # List all containers
container_connect A B   # Connect containers (if command exists)

## üåê ZONES (3D Block Coding - Asset creation areas)  
zone                    # Create zone pair for 3D block coding
zones                   # List all zones
zone 10 0 5             # Create second pair
zone_connect creation_0 viz_1    # Cross-connect data flow

## Universal Being Testing
create_being           # Create basic being
beings                 # List all beings
conscious sphere_1 2   # Make being conscious level 2

## Asset Creator Testing  
shape sphere           # Add sphere to creator
shape box              # Add box to creator
create_being           # Create being from shapes

## Console Testing
help                   # Show available commands
clear                  # Clear console
debug                  # Show debug info

## 3D Block Coding Flow Test
# 1. Create zone pair
zone 0 0 0

# 2. Check they're connected and generating data
zones

# 3. Create second pair and cross-connect
zone 15 0 0
zone_connect creation_0 viz_1
zone_connect creation_1 viz_0

# 4. Watch data flow between zones
# (Visual inspection - should see glowing connections and data interpretation)

## Performance Test
zone 0 0 10
zone 5 0 10  
zone 10 0 10
zone 15 0 10
zone 0 0 20
# (Create multiple zone pairs to test system performance)

## Notes for Testing
# - Check console for consciousness messages from zones
# - Look for green (creation) and purple (visualization) zone boundaries
# - Watch for glowing tube connections between zones
# - Observe different visualization modes being chosen
# - Monitor zone reasoning output in console

## Expected Behaviors
# Creation zones should:
# - Generate points, shapes, or noise every 2 seconds
# - Print consciousness thoughts like "What beauty shall I manifest?"
# - Show green glowing boundaries

# Visualization zones should:
# - Receive data and choose visualization method
# - Print reasoning like "I see patterns - connections reveal meaning"
# - Show purple glowing boundaries
# - Display data as points, connections, voxels, etc.

## Quick Scene Setup for Testing
# Run these commands in sequence to set up a full test scene:
zone                    # Create first pair
zone 10 0 0            # Create second pair  
zone 0 0 10            # Create third pair
zones                  # Verify all created
# Then observe the automatic data generation and visualization
