```
**Expected output:** "ðŸŽ‰ GAMMA IS READY FOR REAL AI CONVERSATIONS!"

### **Step 3: Add Gamma to Your Main Scene**
```
1. Open your main game scene (scenes/main_game.tscn)
2. Add the Gamma AI scene: Instance â†’ scenes/gamma_ai.tscn
3. Position Gamma in the world (she appears as a glowing orb)
```

### **Step 4: Launch and Test**
```
1. Run the game (F5)
2. Look for Gamma (glowing blue orb) in the 3D world
3. Click on her with Divine Cursor to interact
4. Check console for: "ðŸ¤– GAMMA AI: Processing message with real AI..."
```

## ðŸŽ® **HOW TO INTERACT WITH GAMMA:**

### **Method 1: Direct Click (Divine Cursor)**
- Click on Gamma's orb in the 3D world
- She'll respond with real AI-generated conversation
- Watch her transform based on her mood/responses

### **Method 2: txt File Communication**
1. **Write to Gamma:**
   - Edit: `ai_communication/input/Gamma.txt`
   - Add line: `message: Hello Gamma! How are you feeling today?`
   
2. **Read Gamma's Response:**
   - Check: `ai_communication/output/Gamma.txt`
   - She'll write back with real AI responses!

### **Method 3: Behavior Scripts**
- Edit: `actions/ai/gamma_behavior.txt`
- Add triggers like: `when_excited: transform_to_bird`
- Gamma will learn and execute these behaviors

## ðŸ”§ **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **If NobodyWho doesn't appear in Plugins:**
1. Check that files exist in `addons/nobodywho/`
2. Look for `nobodywho.gdextension` file
3. Restart Godot Editor
4. Try Project â†’ Reload Current Project

### **If Gamma doesn't respond:**
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify model file: `ai_models/gamma/gemma-2-2b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf` exists
3. Make sure NobodyWho plugin is enabled
4. Check that GammaController is attached to scene

### **If Performance is Slow:**
1. Lower model parameters in `ai_models/gamma/config.json`
2. Reduce `max_tokens` from 512 to 256
3. Increase `temperature` for faster responses
4. Check Sewers Monitor for bottlenecks
