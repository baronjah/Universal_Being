# Evolution Game Claude - Project Context

## Project Overview
- **Name**: Evolution Game Claude
- **Codename**: evolution_game_claude
- **Purpose**: An evolutionary game system that adapts and grows through Claude AI interactions
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Godot (GDScript), Web Technologies (HTML/JS), Shell Scripts
- **Current Status**: Initial development phase - Foundation building

## Core Concept
An adaptive evolution game where:
- Claude AI acts as the evolution engine
- Game mechanics evolve based on player interactions
- Systems self-improve and adapt over time
- Multi-dimensional gameplay across terminal, web, and desktop
- Akashic records system for persistent memory and learning

## Development Guidelines
- Use `ultrathink` for complex evolution algorithms and AI behavior
- Apply `think harder` for game balance and progression systems
- Use `think hard` for user interface and experience design
- Use `think` for basic feature implementation

## Key Features to Develop
1. **Adaptive Game Mechanics** - Systems that evolve based on player behavior
2. **Claude AI Integration** - Real-time AI-driven game evolution
3. **Multi-Platform Support** - Terminal, web browser, and desktop versions
4. **Akashic Memory System** - Persistent learning and memory across sessions
5. **Visual Evolution Tracking** - See how the game evolves over time
6. **Player Influence Metrics** - Track how player actions shape evolution

## Evolution Concepts
- **Genetic Algorithms** for game rule evolution
- **Neural Network** adaptation for AI behavior
- **Emergent Gameplay** from simple rule interactions
- **Player-Driven Selection** pressure for evolution
- **Multi-Generational** game progression
- **Symbiotic Evolution** between player and AI

## Technical Integration Points
- **Claude API Integration** for real-time evolution decisions
- **Akashic Records Connection** to existing memory systems
- **12 Turns System Integration** with current game frameworks
- **Terminal Interface** compatibility with existing tools
- **Web Interface** for broader accessibility

## Development Phases
1. **Foundation** - Core evolution engine and basic game loop
2. **AI Integration** - Claude interface and decision making
3. **Adaptive Systems** - Self-modifying game mechanics
4. **Multi-Platform** - Expand to web and desktop versions
5. **Advanced Evolution** - Complex emergent behaviors
6. **Community Features** - Shared evolution experiences

## Notes for Claude
- Always consider how new features will interact with the evolution system
- Use advanced thinking modes for complex algorithm design
- Maintain compatibility with existing akashic and turn-based systems
- Prioritize adaptability and extensibility in all designs
- Document evolution patterns and emergent behaviors

## Evolution Game Specific Guidelines
- Every game element should be capable of evolution
- Player actions should influence evolutionary pressure
- AI decisions should be traceable and explainable
- Evolution should be visible and meaningful to players
- System should learn from successful adaptations

## Connection to Existing Systems
- Integrates with 12 turns system for structured gameplay
- Uses akashic records for persistent memory
- Leverages existing Claude integration patterns
- Builds on dimensional and spatial systems
- Extends terminal and web interface capabilities
