# Evolution Game Claude 🧬🎮

**Codename**: evolution_game_claude

An adaptive evolution game where Claude AI acts as the evolution engine, creating emergent gameplay through artificial intelligence and player interaction.

## 🎯 Concept

Evolution Game Claude is an experimental game where:
- **Game mechanics evolve** based on player behavior
- **Claude AI drives evolution** making real-time adaptation decisions  
- **Emergent gameplay** emerges from simple evolutionary rules
- **Player actions create selection pressure** for game evolution
- **Multi-generational progression** with persistent learning
