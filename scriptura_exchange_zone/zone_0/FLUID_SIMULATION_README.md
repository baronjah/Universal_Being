- **Easy integration**: Designed to be dropped into any Godot 4.4 project

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Copy the following files to your Godot 4.4 project:
   - `fluid_simulation_core.gd`
   - `fluid_2d_renderer.gd`
   - `fluid_3d_renderer.gd`
   - `fluid_simulation_demo.gd` (optional)

2. Create a shader folder and include two custom shaders (optional):
   - `shaders/fluid_particle.gdshader`
   - `shaders/fluid_metaball.gdshader`

### Basic Usage

```gdscript
# Create a fluid simulation
var simulation = FluidSimulationCore.new()
add_child(simulation)

# Set up a renderer (2D or 3D)
var renderer = Fluid2DRenderer.new()  # or Fluid3DRenderer
add_child(renderer)
renderer.set_simulation(simulation)

# Create some fluid particles
simulation.create_fluid_cube(
    Vector3(-5, -5, -1),  # min position
    Vector3(5, 5, 1),     # max position
    0.5                   # particle spacing
)

# Run the simulation in _process
func _process(delta):
    simulation.simulate_step(delta)
```

## Common Fluid Patterns

### Creating a Water Pool

```gdscript
# Create a rectangular pool of water
simulation.create_fluid_cube(
    Vector3(-10, -5, -10),  # min position
    Vector3(10, 0, 10),     # max position
    0.5                     # particle spacing
)
```

### Creating a Splash

```gdscript
# Create a splash effect
simulation.create_splash(
    Vector3(0, 0, 0),  # center position
    2.0,               # radius
    100,               # particle count
    5.0                # force strength
)
```

### Creating a Wave

```gdscript
# Create a wave pattern
simulation.create_wave(
    Vector3(-10, 0, 0),  # start position
    20.0,                # width
    1.0,                 # height
    3,                   # wave count
    200                  # particle count
)
```

### Creating a Flowing Stream

```gdscript
# Create a flowing stream of particles
var positions = []
var velocities = []

for i in range(50):
    positions.append(Vector3(-10, 5, randf_range(-2, 2)))
    velocities.append(Vector3(5, 0, 0))  # Flowing right

simulation.create_particles(positions, velocities)
```

### Adding Forces

```gdscript
# Add a whirlpool/vortex
simulation.add_vortex(
    Vector3(0, 0, 0),  # center
    Vector3(0, 1, 0),  # axis (vertical)
    5.0,               # radius
    3.0                # strength
)

# Add a force field (like wind or attraction)
simulation.add_force_field(
    Vector3(0, 5, 0),  # center
    10.0,              # radius
    2.0                # strength (negative for attraction)
)
```

## Customization Options

### Fluid Physics Properties

```gdscript
# Adjust fluid properties
simulation.gravity = Vector3(0, -9.8, 0)
simulation.rest_density = 1000.0  # kg/mÂ³
simulation.viscosity = 0.01       # Lower = more watery, Higher = more like honey
simulation.surface_tension = 0.072  # N/m
simulation.restitution = 0.3      # Bounce factor
```

### Simulation Settings

```gdscript
# Performance and quality settings
simulation.particle_mass = 0.02
simulation.smooth_radius = 0.1     # Interaction radius
simulation.max_particles = 10000   # Limit total particles
simulation.use_spatial_hashing = true  # For performance
simulation.adaptive_time_step = true   # For stability
```

### Rendering Settings (2D)

```gdscript
# 2D Rendering options
renderer2D.particle_size = 20.0
renderer2D.use_metaballs = true
renderer2D.metaball_threshold = 0.5
renderer2D.add_ripples = true
renderer2D.add_foam = true
renderer2D.gradient_top_color = Color(0.0, 0.6, 1.0, 0.8)
renderer2D.gradient_bottom_color = Color(0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 0.9)
```

### Rendering Settings (3D)

```gdscript
# 3D Rendering options
renderer3D.render_method = 1  # 0=Particles, 1=Metaballs, 2=Mesh Surface
renderer3D.surface_detail = 1.0
renderer3D.enable_refraction = true
renderer3D.enable_reflection = true
renderer3D.enable_foam = true
renderer3D.add_ripples = true
```

## Demo Usage

The included demo provides an easy way to experiment with different fluid effects:

```gdscript
# Create a fluid simulation demo
var demo = FluidSimulationDemo.new()
add_child(demo)

# Configure demo
demo.use_2d_mode = true
demo.demo_type = 0  # 0=Water Tank, 1=Wave, 2=Splash, 3=Dam Break, 4=Fountain, 5=Vortex
demo.enable_interaction = true
demo.auto_run = true
```

## How It Works

The fluid simulation uses Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), a technique that simulates fluids by representing them as particles that interact with each other:

1. **Density Calculation**: Calculate fluid density at each particle position using neighboring particles
2. **Pressure Calculation**: Calculate pressure from density using an equation of state
3. **Force Calculation**: Compute forces between particles (pressure, viscosity, surface tension)
4. **Integration**: Update velocities and positions using calculated forces
5. **Boundary Handling**: Ensure particles stay within bounds and handle collisions
6. **Rendering**: Visualize particles using various methods (individual particles, metaballs, mesh surfaces)

## Optimization Tips

For best performance:

1. Limit the maximum number of particles (`max_particles`)
2. Use spatial hashing (`use_spatial_hashing = true`)
3. Use adaptive time steps (`adaptive_time_step = true`)
4. Use frustum culling to skip rendering off-screen particles
5. Decrease `smooth_radius` for fewer interactions (but less accuracy)
6. Use instancing for particle rendering (`use_instancing = true`)
7. Use lower resolution for metaball rendering
8. Adjust surface detail based on distance from camera

## Requirements

- Godot 4.4 or higher
- Decent GPU for fluid visualization, especially in 3D
- For large simulations (10,000+ particles), a modern CPU is recommended

## Known Limitations

- Surface tension model is simplified
- No support for multi-phase fluids (e.g., water and oil)
- Limited interaction with complex colliders
- Metaball rendering can be performance-intensive in 3D
- Large simulations may run slowly on low-end hardware
