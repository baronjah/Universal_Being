# Universal Akashic Connector

The Universal Akashic Connector is a cross-project utility designed to connect and synchronize different Akashic record systems across various projects and platforms. It enables seamless integration of akashic data records, dimensional bridges, and ethereal systems in a unified interface.

## Overview

The Universal Akashic Connector serves as a central hub for all Akashic-related systems, providing:

- **Cross-Project Integration**: Connect Akashic systems across different projects
- **Dimensional Data Access**: Access different dimensional layers of Akashic records
- **System Synchronization**: Keep Akashic data synchronized across all connected systems
- **Record Management**: Store, retrieve, and search across all connected Akashic records
- **Dimensional Gates**: Control access to different dimensional layers
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works with different Akashic implementations (database, bridge, ethereal)

## Key Features

### System Detection and Connection

- Automatically detects existing Akashic systems
- Connects to various types of Akashic implementations
- Supports different connection types (direct, bridge, portal, tunnel)
- Maintains connection status and history

### Dimensional Access Control

- Manages access to different dimensional layers
- Controls dimensional gates (physical, memory, ethereal, akashic, cloud, dimensional, transcendent)
- Adjustable dimension access levels (1-12)
- Dynamic gate opening/closing based on access level

### Record Management

- Universal record storage and retrieval
- Cross-system search capabilities
- Record metadata management
- Dimensional record categorization
- Cached record access for performance

### System Synchronization

- Automated or manual synchronization
- Record distribution across systems
- Transfer queue management
- Synchronization logging and status tracking
- Connection-based synchronization strategies

## Usage

### Initialization

```gdscript
# Create and add the connector to the scene
var connector = UniversalAkashicConnector.new()
add_child(connector)

# The connector will automatically discover and connect to available systems
```

### Storing Records

```gdscript
# Store a record in the Akashic system
var content = "This is an Akashic record"
var metadata = {
    "type": "memo",
    "tags": ["important", "ethereal"],
    "dimension": "akashic"
}

var record_id = connector.store_record(content, metadata)
print("Stored record with ID: " + record_id)
```

### Retrieving Records

```gdscript
# Retrieve a record by ID
var record = connector.retrieve_record(record_id)
if record:
    print("Content: " + record.content)
    print("Metadata: " + str(record.metadata))
```

### Searching Records

```gdscript
# Search for records matching a query
var results = connector.search_records("important", {
    "dimension": "akashic",
    "max_results": 10
})

for result in results:
    print("Found record: " + result.id)
```

### Dimension Access

```gdscript
# Set dimension access level
connector.set_dimension_access(5)

# Open a specific dimensional gate
connector.open_dimensional_gate("ethereal")

# Close a dimensional gate
connector.close_dimensional_gate("transcendent")
```

### System Synchronization

```gdscript
# Synchronize all connected systems
connector.synchronize_systems()

# Synchronize specific systems
connector.synchronize_systems({
    "systems": ["akashic_database", "claude_akashic_bridge"],
    "dimensions": ["akashic", "ethereal"]
})
```

## System Architecture

The Universal Akashic Connector uses a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Core Connector**: Central manager for all systems and connections
2. **Dimensional Gates**: Control access to different dimensional layers
3. **Record Cache**: High-performance cache for frequently accessed records
4. **Transfer Queue**: Manages record distribution across systems
5. **Connection Manager**: Handles system connections and synchronization
6. **Dimension Registry**: Maps and tracks dimensional data and connections

## Integration with Existing Systems

The connector is designed to work with various Akashic system implementations:

- **AkashicDatabaseConnector**: For database-oriented Akashic systems
- **ClaudeAkashicBridge**: For Claude-integrated Akashic bridges
- **EtherealAkashicBridge**: For ethereal dimension bridges
- **Terminal Akashic Interfaces**: For terminal-based Akashic systems
- **Project Connector Systems**: For project-level Akashic integrations

## Development Roadmap

Future development plans for the Universal Akashic Connector include:

1. **Enhanced Visualization**: Visual representation of Akashic connections and dimensions
2. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated record search and filtering
3. **Real-time Synchronization**: Instant updates across all connected systems
4. **Encryption Support**: Secure record storage and transmission
5. **Cloud Integration**: Direct connection to cloud-based Akashic systems
6. **Advanced Dimensional Mapping**: Multi-dimensional record relationships
7. **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Integration with Claude for advanced Akashic analysis

## Requirements

- Godot Engine 3.5+ or 4.0+
- Compatible Akashic system implementations

## Running Tests

Use the included test script to verify functionality:

```bash
# Run the test script
./run_universal_akashic_test.sh
```

## License

Free to use and modify for all Akashic-related projects.
