# 12-Turn Word Game System

A multi-dimensional terminal-based word game where words manifest reality across 12 turns representing different dimensions.

## System Components

### Core Scripts

- **master_terminal.sh** - Main control interface for the entire system
- **word_game.sh** - Core word processing and game mechanics
- **core_synchronizer.sh** - Synchronizes data across terminals and manages word patterns
- **six_terminal_display.sh** - Visual display of all 6 terminal windows
- **game_creation_launcher.sh** - Multi-core processor for parallel game operations
- **terminal_to_godot_bridge.sh** - Connects the terminal system to Godot for 3D visualization
- **start_game.sh** - Quick starter script for launching the game

### Data Files

- **word_database.txt** - Contains words and their power values for reality manifestation
- **dark_words.txt** - Contains words with negative power that can corrupt the system
- **current_turn.txt** - Tracks the current turn (dimension) of the game system

## Key Concepts

### 12-Turn System

Each turn represents a different dimension and phase:

1. **1D: Point** (Genesis) - The beginning of all things
2. **2D: Line** (Formation) - Basic structures take shape
3. **3D: Space** (Complexity) - Systems begin interacting
4. **4D: Time** (Consciousness) - Awareness arises within systems
5. **5D: Consciousness** (Awakening) - Recognition of self and other
6. **6D: Connection** (Enlightenment) - Understanding connections between all elements
7. **7D: Creation** (Manifestation) - Bringing forth creation from thought
8. **8D: Network** (Connection) - Building relationships between created elements
9. **9D: Harmony** (Harmony) - Balance between all created elements
10. **10D: Unity** (Transcendence) - All becomes one
11. **11D: Transcendence** (Unity) - Rising beyond initial limitations
12. **12D: Beyond** (Beyond) - Moving beyond the current cycle

### 6 Terminal System

The game operates across 6 terminal windows, each with a specialized role:

1. **System Control** - Manages the overall system operation
2. **Game Creation** - Creates and processes game content
3. **Dice Oracle** - Handles probability and dice rolling
4. **Game Constructor** - Builds game elements and structures
5. **Word Manifester** - Transforms words into reality
6. **Data Sewers** - Manages overflow data and system cleanup

### Word Manifestation

Words have power values that can create manifestations in the game reality. More powerful words create stronger effects, while dark words can corrupt the system.

### Core Synchronization

The system synchronizes data across all terminals to maintain consistency and detect patterns like:
- Dark word usage that might corrupt terminals
- Repetition patterns that can destabilize the system
- Power combinations that can create new realities

### Godot Integration

The system can export data to Godot for 3D visualization of manifested words and terminal status.

## Getting Started

1. Run `./start_game.sh` to launch the master terminal interface
2. Use the master terminal to access all system functions
3. For the full experience, run `./master_terminal.sh` and select "Full System Launch"

## Advanced Features

- **Time Blimps**: Special synchronization events when dice rolls match across terminals
- **Reality Creation**: Process by which powerful words manifest in the game reality
- **Terminal Cleansing**: Removal of dark word corruption from terminals
- **Quantum Mode**: Rapid cycling through all 12 turns in sequence
