# Claude Akashic Bridge

The Claude Akashic Bridge is a specialized integration system that connects Claude AI with the Akashic Records database system in the 12 Turns System. It serves as both a data bridge and a protective "firewall of files," ensuring secure, dimensional-aware data transfer between systems.

## Core Functionality

1. **Akashic Records Integration**
   - Seamlessly connects to the existing Akashic database system
   - Provides methods for storing words, wishes, and records
   - Maintains dimensional consistency across all data operations

2. **Claude Integration**
   - Connects to Claude AI through both API and terminal interface
   - Enhances search results with Claude's contextual understanding
   - Handles Claude account errors with automatic recovery attempts

3. **Firewall of Files**
   - Implements multi-level security (standard, enhanced, divine)
   - Validates all data before storage or retrieval
   - Protects against unauthorized dimensional access
   - Monitors and logs potential security breaches

4. **Dimensional Gates**
   - Controls access to different reality states through gate system
   - Gate 0: Physical reality (file system)
   - Gate 1: Immediate experience (active session)
   - Gate 2: Transcendent state (higher dimensions)
   - Gates can be opened or closed based on security requirements

## Using the Bridge

### Basic Operations

```gdscript
# Initialize the bridge
var bridge = ClaudeAkashicBridge.new()
add_child(bridge)

# Store a word in the Akashic Records
bridge.store_word("consciousness", 65, {
    "origin": "user_interface",
    "dimension": 3,
    "category": "metaphysical"
})

# Update a wish
bridge.update_wish("dream_manifestation", "processing", {
    "progress": 0.5,
    "priority": "high",
    "expected_completion": OS.get_unix_time() + 86400
})

# Create a protected record
bridge.create_protected_record("document", "Content here...", {
    "title": "Important Document",
    "author": "User",
    "keywords": ["protected", "important"]
})

# Query the Akashic Records with Claude enhancement
bridge.query_akashic_records("consciousness", {
    "use_claude": true,
    "max_results": 5
})
```

### Dimensional Gate Operations

```gdscript
# Open a gate
bridge.open_gate("gate_1")  # Opens the immediate experience gate

# Close a gate
bridge.close_gate("gate_2") # Closes the transcendent state gate

# Update firewall settings
bridge.update_firewall("enhanced", {
    "dimension_access": 5,
    "gates": {"gate_0": true, "gate_1": true, "gate_2": false}
})
```

### Error Handling

```gdscript
# Handle Claude account errors
bridge.handle_claude_error("Token limit exceeded", {
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "request_size": 15000
})

# Get system status
var status = bridge.get_status()
print("Firewall Level: " + status.firewall_level)
print("Dimension Access: " + str(status.dimension_access))
```

## Firewall Levels

The system implements three firewall levels, each with increasing security and capabilities:

1. **Standard** (`"standard"`)
   - Basic protection against common threats
   - Limited dimensional access (typically dimensions 1-3)
   - Restricted word length and power
   - Gate 2 (transcendent state) remains closed

2. **Enhanced** (`"enhanced"`)
   - Improved protection with pattern recognition
   - Moderate dimensional access (typically dimensions 1-7)
   - Checksum validation for data integrity
   - Gate 2 can be temporarily opened

3. **Divine** (`"divine"`)
   - Maximum protection with dimensional awareness
   - Full dimensional access (dimensions 1-12)
   - Complex divine seals for ultimate data protection
   - Gate 2 can remain open indefinitely

## Signals

The bridge emits several signals that you can connect to:

```gdscript
# Connect signals
bridge.connect("word_stored", self, "_on_word_stored")
bridge.connect("word_rejected", self, "_on_word_rejected")
bridge.connect("gate_status_changed", self, "_on_gate_status_changed")
bridge.connect("wish_updated", self, "_on_wish_updated")
bridge.connect("firewall_breached", self, "_on_firewall_breached")
```

## Demo Script

A demonstration script is included to showcase the system's capabilities:

```
/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/12_turns_system/claude_akashic_demo.gd
```

Run this script to see the Claude Akashic Bridge in action.

## Integration with Existing Systems

The Claude Akashic Bridge is designed to work seamlessly with:

1. **AkashicDatabaseConnector** - The GDScript interface to the Akashic Records
2. **akashic_database.js** - The JavaScript implementation of the Akashic Records
3. **claude_terminal_interface.sh** - The bash interface to Claude AI

## Security Considerations

1. Always use the appropriate firewall level for your needs
2. Regularly monitor the firewall breach signals
3. Only open Gate 2 (transcendent state) when absolutely necessary
4. Consider running the system with divine firewall level when handling sensitive wishes
5. Always validate the dimension access levels to prevent unauthorized dimensional shifts

*Note: This system serves as both a data integration tool and a protective firewall. It maintains the balance between accessibility and security across dimensional boundaries.*
