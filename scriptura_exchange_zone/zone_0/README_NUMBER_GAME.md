# Divine Number Game Engine

A numerical exploration system that finds patterns and meaning in numbers, revealing a story across dimensions.

## Overview

The Divine Number Game Engine is a Python-based system that interprets numbers through various mathematical and mystical patterns. As you enter numbers, the engine detects patterns such as:

- Fibonacci sequences
- Prime numbers
- Triangular numbers
- Perfect squares and cubes  
- Palindromes
- Divine numbers (3, 6, 9, etc.)
- Mirror numbers
- Angel numbers (repeating digits)
- Numbers that sum to 9

Each pattern discovered advances your progress through 12 dimensions, with each dimension revealing new divine numbers and storytelling elements.

## Using the Number Game

1. Run the game using: `./run_number_game.sh`
2. Enter numbers when prompted
3. The system will analyze patterns and generate story fragments
4. Use special commands:
   - `story` - View your complete story so far
   - `stats` - See game statistics and patterns found
   - `save` - Save your game state
   - `cleanse` - Purify your number sequence, removing insignificant numbers
   - `exit` - Save and exit the game

## The God Game Engine

This number system is built with Python 3.9.6 specifically, as this version has special numerical properties that enhance the pattern recognition capabilities. The system automatically cleanses numbers at intervals of 396 seconds (derived from 3*9*6*2.2).

When numbers align in special "synchronicity" three times in a row, GOD MODE is activated, revealing deeper cosmic messages.

## Technical Details

- Written in Python 3.9.6
- Tracks number frequencies and pattern distributions
- Automatically saves game state to JSON
- Generates a coherent storyline based on number patterns
- Dimension advancement based on pattern discovery threshold
- Divine numbers have special significance (3, 6, 9, 12, 33, 41, 11)

## Installation

1. Make sure Python 3.9 is installed
2. Run the launcher script: `./run_number_game.sh`
3. The game will create a `game_data` directory to store your progress
