# Enhanced Godot Migration System

A comprehensive toolkit for migrating projects from Godot 3.x to Godot 4.x/4.5+, with special support for JSH Ethereal Engine projects.

## Overview

This advanced system provides tools to automatically convert Godot 3 projects to Godot 4, including:

- Converting node class names (e.g., Spatial → Node3D)
- Updating method calls and properties
- Migrating script syntax (yield → await, signal connections)
- Converting export declarations to the new annotation-based syntax
- Handling resource files (.tres, .tscn)
- Testing migration results
- **NEW:** Special support for JSH Ethereal Engine projects
- **NEW:** Integration with Akashic Records and Dimensional Color systems
- **NEW:** Reality context preservation and migration
- **NEW:** Word manifestation system migration

- Predefined test cases for various migration scenarios
- Functions for running individual or batch tests
- Comprehensive reporting

### Test Runner (`godot4_migration_test_runner.gd`, `godot4_migration_test_runner.tscn`)

Visual interface for the testing system. Features:

- Test case selection
- Result visualization
- Diff viewing
- Batch testing
- Report generation

## Advanced Components

### Ethereal Migration Bridge (`ethereal_migration_bridge.gd`) - NEW!

Specialized migration system for JSH Ethereal Engine projects:

- Detects JSH-specific patterns (BanksCombiner, JSH_records_system, etc.)
- Migrates reality context systems
- Preserves word manifestation capabilities
- Updates thread safety patterns
- Handles DataPoint system migration
- Records migration statistics in Akashic Records format

### Enhanced Launcher (`enhanced_migration_launcher.gd`)

Central coordinator that:

- Integrates all components
- Provides a unified API
- Manages UI instances
- Maintains statistics
- Connects with other systems (color, akashic)

### Unified Migration System (`unified_migration_system.gd`, `unified_migration_system.tscn`) - NEW!

Master controller that:

- Orchestrates all migration components
- Automatically detects project type (standard vs. Ethereal Engine)
- Provides a single unified interface
- Maintains comprehensive statistics
- Connects with external systems like AkashicNumberSystem and DimensionalColorSystem

## Usage

### Basic Migration

1. Run the `unified_migration_system.tscn` scene
2. Select your Godot 3 project path
3. Select your Godot 4 project path (can be empty)
4. Configure options (backup, auto-fix, resources, etc.)
5. Enable Ethereal Engine support if your project uses JSH components
6. Click "Start Migration"

### Testing

1. Open the Test Runner
2. Run individual tests or all tests, including Ethereal Engine specific tests
3. View results and diffs
4. Generate comprehensive reports

### Programmatic Usage

```gdscript
# Using the unified system (recommended)
var migration_system = UnifiedMigrationSystem.new()
migration_system.set_project_paths("/path/to/godot3/project", "/path/to/godot4/project")
var result = migration_system.start_migration()

# For JSH Ethereal Engine projects
var ethereal_bridge = EtherealMigrationBridge.new()
var result = ethereal_bridge.migrate_jsh_ethereal_project("/path/to/godot3/project", "/path/to/godot4/project")

# Check compatibility
var report = migration_system.generate_compatibility_report("/path/to/project")

# Using the enhanced launcher
var launcher = EnhancedMigrationLauncher.new()
launcher.start_migration_ui()
launcher.start_test_runner()
```

## Integration with Other Systems

### Color System Integration

When connected to the DimensionalColorSystem, the migration tools visualize:

- Migration progress with color harmonics
- Errors and warnings with appropriate colors
- Success rates with color gradients
- Reality transitions with color shifts
- Word manifestations with symbolic colors

### Akashic System Integration

Records migration statistics in the AkashicNumberSystem:

- Number of migrations performed
- Success rates and patterns
- Test results
- Timestamps and migration durations
- Reality context transitions
- Word manifestation patterns
- Record set migrations

## Ethereal Engine Migration Features

The system provides specialized migration for JSH Ethereal Engine components:

### Records System Migration

- Updates `JSH_records_system.add_basic_set()` syntax
- Converts `BanksCombiner.data_sets_names_0` access patterns
- Migrates `remember()` and `recall()` functions
- Updates record access and storage methods
- Preserves record set structures

### Reality System Migration 

- Migrates reality transition system
- Preserves reality contexts across migration
- Updates reality-specific physics and rendering
- Maintains reality-aware memory systems
- Creates modernized reality transition effects

### Word Manifestation Migration

- Preserves word manifestation capabilities
- Updates 3D text rendering for Godot 4
- Converts physics interactions to new system
- Maintains word transformation effects
- Preserves word-reality interactions

### DataPoint Migration

- Updates DataPoint state serialization
- Preserves terminal history in records
- Migrates command processing systems
- Updates UI components to Godot 4 Control nodes

### Thread Safety Updates

## Migration Coverage

The system handles all standard Godot 3 to 4 conversions plus:

- **JSH-specific Patterns**: BanksCombiner, JSH_records_system, reality contexts, etc.
- **Memory Systems**: remember/recall functions, player_memory storage
- **Reality Transitions**: reality_shift records, transition effects

- **Enhanced Word Manifestation**: Updated word system with improved physics and visuals

## Getting Started

1. Add the system to your Godot project
2. Run the main scene `unified_migration_system.tscn`
3. Select your project and migration options
4. Start the migration process

## Requirements

- Godot 4.0 or higher to run the migration tool itself
- Projects to be migrated can be Godot 3.x (preferably 3.5+)
- For Ethereal Engine projects, Godot 4.2+ is recommended

## Notes and Limitations

- Always verify the migration results manually
- Some complex code patterns may need manual intervention
- Custom shaders may require specific adjustments
- C# projects are not currently supported
- GDExtension/NativeScript conversion requires manual work
- Reality transition shaders may need manual tweaking for specific effects
