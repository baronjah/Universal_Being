# JSH Ethereal Engine Documentation

## Overview
This documentation covers the JSH Ethereal Engine, a system designed to create a dynamic, entity-based universe where words shape reality and entities can evolve, transform, and interact across multiple dimensions.

## Core Components

The project is organized into the following major components:

### Core System
- [Core System Index](core/_INDEX.md) - Foundation classes and initialization systems
- Main controllers and system-wide functionality

### Entity System
- [Entity System Index](entity/_INDEX.md) - Universal entity framework
- Entity creation, management, and evolution

### Word Manifestation 
- [Word System Index](word/_INDEX.md) - Word analysis and manifestation
- Systems for converting words into entity properties

### Console Interface
- [Console System Index](console/_INDEX.md) - Command input and processing
- User interface for interacting with the system

### Database System
- [Database System Index](database/_INDEX.md) - Data storage and retrieval
- File system integration and data management

### Spatial Management
- [Spatial System Index](spatial/_INDEX.md) - Spatial organization and queries
- Grid, octree, and dimensional management

### Integration Layer
- [Integration Index](integration/_INDEX.md) - System connections and bridges
- Cross-component communication and coordination

### Visualization
- [Visualization Index](visualization/_INDEX.md) - Entity visualization
- Visual representation and effects
