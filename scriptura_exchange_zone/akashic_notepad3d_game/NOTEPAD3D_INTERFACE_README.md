# Notepad 3D Layered Interface System

## Overview
The Notepad 3D Environment creates a revolutionary layered 3D terminal interface that transforms traditional text editing into an immersive spatial experience. This system allows users to navigate through different depths of information in a walkable 3D environment.

## System Architecture

### 5-Layer Depth System
1. **Layer 0: Current Text** (5.0 units)
   - Primary writing and editing space
   - Full interactivity and editing capabilities
   - Highest detail and brightness
   - Real-time word evolution and interaction

2. **Layer 1: Recent Context** (8.0 units)
   - Previous editing sessions and changes
   - Recent file modifications and history
   - Medium detail with reduced interaction

3. **Layer 2: File Structure** (12.0 units)
   - Project file tree and organization
   - Directory structure visualization
   - Lower detail, reference only

4. **Layer 3: Akashic Data** (16.0 units)
   - Database connections and records
   - Navigation hierarchy state
   - Statistical information and metrics

5. **Layer 4: Cosmic Background** (20.0 units)
   - Universal constants and sacred geometry
   - Deepest philosophical and cosmic context
   - Minimal detail, atmospheric presence

## Features Implemented

### Visual System
- **Curved Screens**: Each layer uses curved display surfaces that bend toward the user
- **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Progressive quality reduction with distance
- **Transparency Layers**: Each layer becomes more transparent with depth
- **Color-Coded Markers**: Layer navigation spheres with unique colors
- **Glow Effects**: Enhanced visibility for focused layers

### Navigation System
- **Layer Focus**: Tab through layers with visual emphasis
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated camera movements between layers
- **Walkable Environment**: Invisible floor plane for free movement
- **Auto-Framing**: Automatic camera positioning for optimal viewing

### Content Management
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Each layer can display different information types
- **LOD-Based Display**: Text detail adapts to layer distance and importance
- **Real-Time Updates**: Content can be updated without recreating the environment

## Controls

### Current Keybindings
- **N**: Toggle Notepad 3D interface visibility
- **F**: Auto-frame camera to current layer
- **Tab**: Toggle traditional navigation panel
- **WASD/Arrows**: Navigate within current layer
- **E/Click**: Interact with text elements
- **R/Right Click**: Evolve selected words
- **C**: Create new words

### Planned Navigation
- **Page Up/Down**: Move between layers
- **Shift + WASD**: Walk around the 3D environment
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out of layers
- **Ctrl + Click**: Quick layer jump

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
1. **Notepad3DEnvironment** (`notepad3d_environment.gd`)
   - Main controller for the layered interface
   - Manages layer creation and positioning
   - Handles LOD and visual optimization

2. **Layer Management**
   - Dynamic layer creation with configurable distances
   - Automatic LOD calculation based on focus and distance
   - Material and transparency management

3. **Content Integration**
   - Demo content showing different information types
   - Akashic database integration ready
   - File system visualization prepared

### Performance Optimization
- **LOD System**: Reduces detail for distant layers
- **Transparency Culling**: Invisible layers don't render text
- **Focused Rendering**: Only active layers receive full processing
- **Smooth Transitions**: Interpolated changes prevent jarring updates

## Demo Content Loaded

The system now includes comprehensive demo content showing:

1. **Current Text Layer**: Active GDScript code with functions and variables
2. **Recent Context**: Editing history and recent changes
3. **File Structure**: Complete project file tree
4. **Akashic Data**: Database statistics and connection info
5. **Cosmic Background**: Sacred geometry and universal constants

## Integration Status

âœ… **Completed**:
