# LuminusOS Multi-API Implementation Notes

## Overview

This implementation creates a multi-button interface in Godot for comparing responses from different API services (Claude and Gemini). The system allows you to:

1. Enter a prompt
2. Call either API individually 
3. Compare the results side-by-side

## Key Files

- `api_controller.gd` - Core logic for managing API calls
- `api_interface.gd` - UI interaction handling
- `api_interface.tscn` - UI layout for the API interface
- `multi_api_demo.tscn` - Main scene with styling

## Testing the Implementation

1. Open the Godot project located at `/mnt/c/Users/Percision 15/LuminusOS/`
2. Run the `multi_api_demo.tscn` scene
3. Enter a prompt in the text area
4. Click either "Claude API" or "Gemini API" button
5. Once both APIs have been called, the "Compare Responses" button will become active
6. Click "Compare Responses" to see both results side-by-side

## Simulation Mode

For testing purposes, the implementation uses a simulation mode to generate fake API responses without requiring actual API keys. This allows you to test the UI flow and interactions without setting up real API credentials.

To use with real APIs:
1. Set `simulation_mode = false` in `api_controller.gd`
2. Add your actual API keys in the appropriate sections

## Extending the System

### Adding More APIs

To add additional API services:
1. Add a new entry to the `apis` dictionary in `api_controller.gd`
2. Create a new button in `api_interface.tscn`
3. Add a new panel for displaying responses
4. Update the comparison view to include the new API

### Visual Customization

The interface uses a purple theme to match the Luminous OS aesthetic. You can customize:
- Button colors (modulate property)
- Panel styles (SubResource in multi_api_demo.tscn)
- Label colors and fonts

## Integration with Word Manifestation

This implementation can connect to your Word of Worlds manifestation system by:
1. Passing API responses to your word processor
2. Visualizing words based on API-generated properties
3. Creating different manifestation styles based on which API generated the content

## Future Enhancements

1. Add animation transitions between different API views
2. Implement color shift effects based on responses
3. Create a 3D visualization mode for comparing responses spatially
4. Add a "blend" mode that combines responses from multiple APIs
