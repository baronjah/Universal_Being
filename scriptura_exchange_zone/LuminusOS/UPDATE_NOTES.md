# LuminusOS Multi-API System Update

## Implementation Complete

I've implemented a complete multi-API system with turn tracking for LuminusOS. This system allows you to:

1. Call different API services (Claude and Gemini) via separate buttons
2. Track your position in the 12-turn cycle with visual feedback
3. Get cost estimates for API usage
4. Receive break notifications at turn boundaries

## Key Files Added

- `api_controller.gd` - Base API communication handler
- `api_interface.gd` - UI interaction management
- `turn_tracker.gd` - 12-turn system implementation
- `turn_display.tscn` - Visual turn indicator panel
- `break_notification.tscn` - Break reminder system
- `api_controller_with_turns.gd` - Enhanced API controller with turn integration

## Turn System Features

The implementation faithfully follows your 12-turn system with the Greek symbols (α through μ) for phase tracking. Each API call advances the turn counter, and every 12 turns triggers a break notification.

The system tracks:
- Current turn (1-12)
- Current phase (Genesis through Beyond)
- API usage counts
- Estimated cost of API calls

## Visual Elements

- Purple-themed interface matching LuminusOS aesthetics
- Progress bar showing turn completion
- Cost estimate display
- Break notification with animation

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the Godot project in the LuminusOS directory
2. Replace the existing `api_controller.gd` with `api_controller_with_turns.gd`
3. Add the `TurnTracker` and `TurnDisplay` nodes to your main scene
4. Add the `BreakNotification` scene as a child of your main interface

## Using the System

- Each API call (Claude or Gemini) will advance the turn counter
- Every 12 turns, a break notification will appear
- The system is in simulation mode by default - no real API calls will be made
- API responses include turn information at the end

## Next Steps

To complete your multi-device integration:
1. Connect this system to your iPad via a web interface or native app
2. Implement the symbolic representation system for resource tracking
3. Design the data normalization framework for game evolution

The system provides a solid foundation for your "Word of Worlds" manifestation system while helping you manage API costs and maintain a healthy rhythm with automatic break reminders.
