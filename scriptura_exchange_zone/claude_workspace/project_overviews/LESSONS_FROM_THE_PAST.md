## 🐛 Bug Fix Patterns

### 1. **The InputMap Error Pattern**
**Problem:** "InputMap action 'crouch' doesn't exist" spam
**Root Cause:** Code assumes actions exist without checking
**Solution:**
```gdscript
# Always wrap InputMap checks
func _is_action_safe(action: String) -> bool:
    if InputMap.has_action(action):
        return Input.is_action_pressed(action)
    return false
```
**Lesson:** Never assume external resources exist - always validate

### 2. **The Cascading Autoload Conflict**
**Problem:** Multiple autoloads trying to control same system
**Root Cause:** Different systems registering same commands
**Solution:** 
- Comment out conflicting autoloads in project.godot
- Create single source of truth for each system
**Lesson:** Autoload order matters, avoid duplicate functionality

### 3. **The Ground Disappearing Mystery**
**Problem:** Ground vanishes after scene loads
**Root Cause:** Scene manager hiding but not restoring
**Solution:**
```gdscript
func _ensure_ground_visible() -> void:
    if original_ground and not original_ground.visible:
        original_ground.visible = true
```
**Lesson:** Always track state changes and provide restoration

### 4. **The NaN Physics Explosion**
**Problem:** Ragdoll physics producing NaN values
**Root Cause:** Cross product of near-parallel vectors
**Solution:**
```gdscript
if cross_product.length_squared() > 0.001:  # Threshold check
    # Safe to use cross product
```
**Lesson:** Validate mathematical operations before using results

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns That Work

### 1. **Single Process Delta Philosophy**
Instead of multiple `_process()` functions:
```gdscript
# BackgroundProcessManager handles all updates
process_manager.register_process(self, "_update_logic", ProcessType.PHYSICS)
```

### 2. **Console Command Pattern**
```gdscript
# Self-documenting command registration
console.register_command("spawn_ragdoll", 
    _spawn_ragdoll,
    "Spawn a ragdoll at origin")
```

### 3. **Safe Scene Loading**
```gdscript
# Always preserve critical objects
var original_ground = get_node_or_null("/root/MainGame/World/Ground")
# ... do scene operations ...
if original_ground:
    original_ground.visible = true
```

## 🔄 Common Integration Issues

### Issue: "Fixing A breaks B, fixing B breaks A"
**Example:** Console visibility vs physics debug display
**Pattern:** Hidden dependencies between systems
**Solution:** 
1. Document all system interactions
2. Create clear interfaces between systems
3. Test changes in isolation first

### Issue: "Commands work individually but not together"
**Example:** setup_systems breaking object_inspector
**Pattern:** Global state contamination
**Solution:**
1. Minimize global state
2. Use signals for communication
3. Create system reset functions

## 💡 Performance Optimization Lessons

### 1. **Process Function Overload**
**Before:** 50+ objects with `_process()` = lag
**After:** Centralized process manager = smooth
**Key:** Batch similar operations

### 2. **Debug Tool Impact**
**Before:** All debug tools always running
**After:** Load-on-demand pattern
**Key:** `if debug_enabled:` guards

### 3. **Scene Cleanup Performance**
**Before:** Clear command freezes with many objects
**After:** Batch deletion in chunks
**Key:** `queue_free()` in groups

## 🛠️ Debugging Techniques That Work

### 1. **The Binary Search Debug**
When multiple systems break:
1. Disable half the autoloads
2. Test which half has the issue
3. Repeat until isolated

### 2. **The State Snapshot**
Before major operations:
```gdscript
var state_before = {
    "ground_visible": ground.visible,
    "ragdoll_count": get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("ragdolls").size(),
    "console_open": console.visible
}
```

### 3. **The Breadcrumb Trail**
```gdscript
print("🔍 [System] Entering dangerous function")
print("🔍 [System] State: ", important_variable)
print("🔍 [System] Exiting successfully")
```

## 📋 Checklist Before Adding Features

- [ ] Will this conflict with existing autoloads?
- [ ] Does this add a new `_process()` function?
- [ ] Are all InputMap actions validated?
- [ ] Is there a way to disable/enable this feature?
- [ ] Have I documented the connections to other systems?
- [ ] Is there a console command to test this?
- [ ] Can this be loaded on-demand instead of at startup?

## 🎯 Project-Specific Wisdom

### Ragdoll Physics
- Always validate vectors before physics operations
- Smaller collision shapes = fewer joint conflicts
- Disable what you're not using

### Console Systems
- One console to rule them all
- Commands should be self-documenting
- Always provide feedback to user

### Scene Management
- Track what you hide
- Restore what you change
- Clean up what you create

## 🔮 Future-Proofing Strategies

1. **Make It Toggleable** - Every feature should have an off switch
2. **Make It Modular** - Systems should work independently
3. **Make It Observable** - Add debug output options
4. **Make It Reversible** - Every action needs an undo
