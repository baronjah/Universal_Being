# Akashic Notepad 3D Test Project

This is a test integration of the Akashic Records and Notepad3D systems from the 12_turns_system project.

## Overview

This project integrates several key components with **full Eden Pitopia Integration support**:

1. **SpatialWorldStorage** - Manages 3D notebooks and akashic records
2. **Notepad3DVisualizer** - Handles 3D visualization of words, connections, and dimensional transitions
3. **SpatialNotepadIntegration** - Connects storage with visualization
4. **AkashicNotepadController** - Coordinates the entire system
5. **WordManifestationSystem** - Handles word physics and manifestation
6. **ðŸ”— EdenPitopiaBridge** - **NEW!** Connects to the full Eden Pitopia Integration system

## ðŸŒŸ Eden Integration Features

When the Eden integration is detected, you get access to:
- âœ… **6 Reality Types** (Physical, Digital, Astral, Quantum, Memory, Dream)
- âœ… **12 Dimensions** with Greek symbols (Î±-Î¼)
- âœ… **8 Moon Phases** affecting gate stability and word power
- âœ… **Cyber Gates** for reality transitions
- âœ… **Data Sewers** for efficient storage
- âœ… **Advanced Command System** with 15+ commands
- âœ… **Reality-specific Effects** and visualizations

## How to Test

### In Godot Editor:
1. Open the project in Godot 4.x
2. Run the main scene (`scenes/main_test_scene.tscn`)
3. Click the "Run Test" button to execute integration tests
4. Use keyboard controls to navigate the 3D space

### Keyboard Controls:
- **WASD** - Move camera
- **Q/E** - Move up/down
- **Right-click + drag** - Rotate camera  
- **Mouse wheel** - Zoom
- **R** - Reset camera
- **T** - Run tests
- **C** - Clear all data
- **V** - Toggle visualization mode
- **E** - Show Eden integration status

### Test Sequence:
1. **Create Akashic Entries** - Creates sample akashic records with different dimensions and tags
2. **Create Notepad** - Creates a test notepad with sample cells
3. **Visualize Akashic Records** - Displays akashic entries in 3D space
4. **Create Connections** - Links related akashic entries
5. **Notepad Integration** - Displays notepad cells in 3D

## Features Tested

### Akashic Records:
- Creating entries with position, dimension, and tags
- Finding entries by dimension and tags
- Creating connections between entries
- Spatial synergy detection
- 3D visualization of entries

### Notepad3D:
- Creating notebooks with cells
- Positioning cells in 3D space
- Visualizing notebooks in 3D
- Converting akashic entries to notebook cells

### Integration:
- Bridge between storage and visualization
- Real-time updates of 3D representations
- Interactive 3D interface
- Multi-dimensional coordinate system

## System Architecture

```
AkashicNotepadController
â”œâ”€â”€ SpatialWorldStorage (data management)
â”œâ”€â”€ SpatialNotepadIntegration (bridge)
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ”— EdenPitopiaBridge (Eden connection)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Reality System (6 types)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dimension System (12 dimensions)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Moon Phase System (8 phases)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cyber Gates (reality transitions)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Data Sewers (storage management)
â””â”€â”€ Notepad3DVisualizer (3D rendering)
    â”œâ”€â”€ WordManifestationSystem (physics)
    â””â”€â”€ Camera/Lighting/Environment
```

## ðŸš€ Eden Commands (when connected)

- `/reality [type]` - Switch between reality types
- `/gate [target]` - Create cyber gate to another reality
- `/sewer` - Create data sewer for storage
- `/moon [phase]` - Set moon phase (affects stability)
- `/eden-status` - Show Eden integration status
- `/word-power [word]` - Calculate divine word power
- `/note [text]` - Manifest word in 3D space
- `/memory [tier] [text]` - Store memory in tier system
- `/connect [word1] to [word2]` - Connect manifested words

## File Structure

- `scripts/spatial_world_storage.gd` - Core data storage system
- `scripts/notepad3d_visualizer.gd` - 3D visualization engine
- `scripts/spatial_notepad_integration.gd` - Integration bridge
- `scripts/akashic_notepad_controller.gd` - Main controller
- `scripts/word_manifestation_system.gd` - Word physics system
- `scripts/akashic_test_main.gd` - Test orchestration
- `scripts/eden_pitopia_bridge.gd` - **NEW!** Eden integration bridge
- `scenes/main_test_scene.tscn` - Main test scene

## Expected Results

When tests run successfully, you should see:
- Console output showing test progress
- 3D words and connections appearing in the viewport
- Status updates showing record/cell counts
- Interactive 3D navigation working

## Notes

This is a simplified test version focusing on core integration. The full system includes:
- File persistence
- Multi-dimensional physics
- Advanced word evolution
- Reality transitions
- Turn-based cosmic cycles

To integrate into your main project, copy the working components and adapt the initialization sequence to match your project structure.

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail:
1. Check console output for error messages
2. Verify all script files are properly loaded
3. Ensure scene node structure matches script expectations
4. Try running individual test steps manually
