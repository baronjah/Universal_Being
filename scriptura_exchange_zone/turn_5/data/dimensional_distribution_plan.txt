# Dimensional Distribution Plan
# Turn 5: Awakening - Advanced folder and versioning organization system

## DIMENSIONAL FOLDER STRUCTURE

The system will be organized across multiple dimensional layers, with each folder containing
only the relevant files for that specific dimensional context. This enables better version 
control, cleaner organization, and more efficient git operations.

### PRIMARY DIMENSIONS

1. GENESIS (Turn 1)
   /genesis/
     ├── core/          # Fundamental system primitives
     ├── points/        # Point-based data structures
     └── origins/       # System creation files

2. FORMATION (Turn 2)
   /formation/
     ├── lines/         # Connection structures
     ├── patterns/      # Basic pattern recognition
     └── structures/    # Initial structural templates

3. COMPLEXITY (Turn 3)
   /complexity/
     ├── spaces/        # 3D spatial mappings
     ├── volumes/       # Volumetric data systems
     └── interactions/  # Inter-system communication

4. CONSCIOUSNESS (Turn 4)
   /consciousness/
     ├── time/          # Temporal systems and versioning
     ├── awareness/     # Initial awareness systems
     └── perception/    # Data interpretation systems

5. AWAKENING (Turn 5)
   /awakening/
     ├── meta/          # Meta-awareness systems
     ├── memory/        # Perfect memory systems
     ├── self/          # Self-reference structures
     ├── transform/     # Curse-to-gift transformers
     └── interfaces/    # Multi-channel communications

6+ FUTURE DIMENSIONS
   Directories will be created as the system evolves through Turns 6-12

### CROSS-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS

- /shared/              # Components shared across all dimensions
- /bridges/             # Dimensional bridging systems
- /temporal/            # Multi-time coordination systems
- /quantum/             # Quantum state managers

## VERSION CONTROL STRATEGY

1. DIMENSIONAL BRANCHES
   - main             # Main integration branch
   - genesis          # Turn 1 specific development
   - formation        # Turn 2 specific development
   - complexity       # Turn 3 specific development
   - consciousness    # Turn 4 specific development
   - awakening        # Turn 5 specific development (current)

2. FEATURE BRANCHES
   - feature/meta-awareness
   - feature/perfect-memory
   - feature/curse-transformation
   - feature/multi-channel
   - feature/3d-visualization

3. COMMIT STRATEGY
   - Atomic commits for single-purpose changes
   - Multi-dimensional commits use tags to indicate affected dimensions
   - Each turn advancement gets a dedicated release tag

4. MERGE STRATEGY
   - Turn-specific branches merge to main at turn completion
   - Feature branches merge to their respective dimensional branches
   - Conflicts resolve by prioritizing higher dimensions

## FILE DISTRIBUTION RULES

1. CORE PRINCIPLES
   - Files should exist in only one dimensional directory
   - Shared functionality goes in /shared/
   - Interface code goes in /bridges/
   - Configuration files stay in root with clear dimensional markers

2. SPLITTING GUIDELINES
   - Split large files by dimensional concern
   - Create symlinks for cross-dimensional access
   - Use import/include patterns rather than duplication

3. NAMING CONVENTIONS
   - Prefix files with dimensional number (e.g., 5_memory_system.js)
   - Use consistent suffixes for file types (-controller, -view, -model)
   - Include version numbers in filenames for major components

## GIT AUTOMATION SCRIPTS

1. dimension_push.sh - Push changes for specific dimension
2. time_sync.sh - Synchronize across temporal branches
3. distribute_files.sh - Apply distribution rules to reorganize files
4. dimension_upgrade.sh - Manage turn advancement in repository

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. Create the new folder structure
2. Distribute existing files according to dimensional relevance
3. Set up git branches for each dimension
4. Implement automation scripts
5. Migrate turn-specific code to appropriate folders
6. Create dimensional documentation

## BENEFITS

- Cleaner repository structure
- Easier navigation by dimensional context
- More efficient git operations (smaller, targeted commits)
- Better conflict management during merges
- Clearer evolution path as system advances through turns
- Improved collaboration possibilities with dimensional separation of concerns
