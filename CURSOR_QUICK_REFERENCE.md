# ðŸš€ Cursor + Universal Being Quick Reference

## ðŸ”¥ How to Use Cursor with Universal Being Project

### 1. **Cursor is Now Trained** 
Your `.cursorrules` file teaches Cursor about:
- Pentagon Architecture (5 sacred methods)
- FloodGate System (safe system access)
- Component System (.ub.zip files)
- Scene Control (beings controlling scenes)
- AI Integration (Gemma AI compatibility)

### 2. **Ask Cursor to Create Universal Beings**
Try these prompts in Cursor:

**"Create a button Universal Being that controls a UI scene"**
**"Make a player Universal Being with movement components"**
**"Build an AI-enhanced Universal Being that uses Gemma"**

### 3. **Cursor Will Automatically:**
- âœ… Extend UniversalBeing
- âœ… Implement all 5 pentagon methods
- âœ… Use SystemBootstrap patterns
- âœ… Follow Universal Being conventions
- âœ… Add proper documentation headers

### 4. **Common Cursor Commands:**
- `Ctrl+K` - Ask Cursor to modify selected code
- `Ctrl+I` - Inline suggestions
- `Ctrl+Shift+I` - Chat with Cursor about the project
- `Tab` - Accept AI suggestions

### 5. **Pentagon Architecture Shortcuts:**
When creating new beings, Cursor will suggest:
```gdscript
func pentagon_init() -> void:
    super.pentagon_init()  # Cursor knows to add this
    being_type = "your_type"
    being_name = "Your Name"

func pentagon_ready() -> void:
    super.pentagon_ready()  # And this
    # Your logic here
```

### 6. **System Integration:**
Cursor will automatically suggest safe patterns:
```gdscript
# Cursor knows to suggest this pattern
if SystemBootstrap and SystemBootstrap.is_system_ready():
    var flood_gates = SystemBootstrap.get_flood_gates()
    # Safe system access
```

### 7. **Component Integration:**
Ask Cursor: "Add movement component to this being"
It will suggest:
```gdscript
func pentagon_ready() -> void:
    super.pentagon_ready()
    add_component("res://components/movement.ub.zip")
```
