# ðŸŽ¯ While Claude Code Fixes - Parallel Tasks

## For Cursor:
1. **Create ConsciousnessEffectManager** (from cursor_quick.md)
2. **Start sketching icon designs** (even rough is fine)
3. **Test pentagon flash animation** in a simple scene

## For Luminus:
1. **Create consciousness descriptions** for UI display:
```gdscript
const LEVEL_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    0: "Dormant - The void awaits awakening",
    1: "Awakening - First spark of consciousness",
    2: "Aware - Choices emerge from chaos",
    3: "Conscious - Foundations take root",
    4: "Enlightened - Six stars guide the way",
    5: "Transcendent - All forms flow as one",
    6: "Beyond - Self-awareness complete",
    7: "Ultimate - Eternal transformation"
}
```

## For Luno:
Review the PentagonNetworkVisualizer and suggest specific optimization points

## For All:
Think about the Genesis Conductor first test - what should happen when we press 'G'?
