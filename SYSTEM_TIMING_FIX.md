# ðŸ”§ System Timing Issue Fixed

## Problem Identified:
The SystemBootstrap was initializing correctly, but main.gd wasn't detecting it properly due to:

1. **Wrong Method Call**: Was calling `SystemBootstrap.get_bootstrap_instance()` (doesn't exist) instead of directly accessing `SystemBootstrap` autoload
2. **Timing Issue**: SystemBootstrap signal might fire before main.gd connects to it
3. **Missing Error Handling**: F8 was causing crashes due to insufficient system readiness checks

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Fixed SystemBootstrap Detection
```gdscript
# OLD (broken):
var bootstrap = SystemBootstrap.get_bootstrap_instance()

# NEW (working):
if SystemBootstrap:
```

### 2. Added Timing Safety Check
```gdscript
SystemBootstrap.system_ready.connect(on_systems_ready)
# Also check again after a short delay in case of timing issues
await get_tree().create_timer(0.1).timeout
if SystemBootstrap.is_system_ready() and not systems_ready:
    on_systems_ready()
```

### 3. Enhanced F8 Error Handling
```gdscript
func create_claude_desktop_mcp_bridge() -> Node:
    if not systems_ready:
        print("ðŸ”Œ Cannot create MCP bridge - systems not ready")
        return null
    # ... rest of creation logic
```

## Expected Results:
- âœ… Systems should now be detected as ready
- âœ… F3, F4, F5, F7, F8 should work without "systems not ready" errors
- âœ… F8 should create MCP bridge instead of crashing
- âœ… All Universal Being creation should work properly

## Test Commands:
- F2 - Should show "Systems Ready: true"
- F3 - Should create test beings
- F8 - Should create Claude Desktop MCP Bridge
- G - Should create Genesis Conductor

The Universal Being Engine should now be fully operational!
