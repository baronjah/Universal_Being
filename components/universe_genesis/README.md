# üåå Universe Genesis System

## Overview
The Universe Genesis System brings the vision of "simulation within simulation" to life in the Universal_Being project. Create infinite recursive universes, each with unique DNA, physics laws, and consciousness traits.

## Features

### üß¨ Universe DNA System
Every universe inherits traits from its parent with mutations:
- **Physics Traits**: Gravity, time elasticity, matter density, energy flow
- **Consciousness Traits**: Awareness level, creativity, harmony, evolution speed
- 20% mutation chance creates unique universes

### üé® Universe Templates
Pre-configured universe types:
- **Sandbox**: Standard physics playground
- **Narrative**: Cinematic story realms  
- **Quantum**: Micro-scale physics experiments
- **Paradise**: Peaceful, indestructible worlds

### ‚è∞ Time Dilation
Control time flow from 0.1x to 10.0x speed. Fast-forward centuries or observe in slow motion.

### üîÑ Recursive Creation
Create nested universes up to 5 levels deep. Each universe can contain child universes infinitely.

## Console Commands

```bash
# Template creation
universe template sandbox MyWorld
universe template quantum QuantumLab
universe template narrative StoryRealm
universe template paradise Eden

# Recursive universes
universe recursive 3        # 3 levels deep
universe recursive 5 2      # 5 levels, 2 per level

# DNA management
universe dna               # View current DNA
universe evolve gravity 5.0 # Modify traits

# Time control
universe time 2.5          # 2.5x speed
universe simulate 1000     # Simulate 1000 years

# Navigation
enter MyWorld             # Enter universe
exit                      # Return to parent
portal QuantumLab         # Create portal
```

## Visual Simulator (Ctrl+O)

The Universe Simulator provides:
- 3D visualization of universes
- Hierarchical universe tree
- Real-time statistics
- Timeline scrubbing
- Zoom and navigation controls

## Natural Language Examples

In the console, you can say:
- "Create a universe called Wonderland"
- "Make a quantum universe with fast time"
- "Show me the DNA of this universe"
- "Make time go 10 times faster"
- "Create 5 nested universes"

## Getting Started

1. Press `~` to open console
2. Type: `universe template sandbox MyFirstUniverse`
3. Press `Ctrl+O` to open Universe Simulator
4. Click on your universe to explore
5. Create child universes and experiment!

## Tips

- Start with sandbox template for experimentation
- Use quantum template for particle simulations
- Paradise template creates beautiful, peaceful worlds
- DNA traits affect how beings evolve in each universe
- Higher consciousness awareness = smarter AI beings
